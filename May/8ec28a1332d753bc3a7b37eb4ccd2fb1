 Every day SANBS requires over 3 300 donations to meet its patients’ demand across the country. The blood service has implemented measures to ensure the continued safety of blood donors at the donor sites. These include: • Screening all persons at donation clinic entrances.
• Donors exhibiting flu-like symptoms or symptoms of infections are advised to delay donation until they are well.
• SANBS staff are screened daily and staff with flu-like symptoms or symptoms of infection do not work in clinics until they are well.

In addition, surfaces and equipment are disinfected before the clinic starts, following each donation event and at the end of the day.
• All staff wear appropriate personal protective equipment while on duty. Please remember that the public is required to wear a mask when visiting one of the donation sites.
