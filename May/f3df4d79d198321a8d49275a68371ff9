 MBOMBELA – The school is a non-profit organisation and one of many schools that rely heavily on support and donations from the community. Schools closed on March 18 after President Cyril Ramaphosa declared a national state of disaster. In some schools, school fees paid by parents help pay the school’s bills as well as salaries.

We have only managed to pay our cleaners and teacher’s assistants and we have only paid our teachers a small portion of their salaries, which will allow them to only buy groceries. Our management team has also not been paid as of yet,” said Claudi Engelbrecht, academic head and educational psychologist at the Learning Centre. Engelbrecht mentioned the efforts the school is making to keep the learners up to date, which includes offering online therapy and online learning for their learners.
