 South Africa, and the rest of the world, is currently suffering a Covid-19 pandemic. This has raised many questions for women who expect to give birth during this period. We spoke to mom, Dudu Moreko, who had twin boys during lockdown. She shared her tips for raising a baby during lockdown with other mothers. Thabo and Thabang Lekhuleni, were born on April 24, 2020 at 36 weeks at Mediclinic Nelspruit. READ: Planning a special occasion during lockdown The twins were named after their father, Thabo. “It’s a pleasant feeling. It feels like it’s your first child even if you have other children. Super natural feeling. It was scary, the fear of catching Covid-19, but our health practitioners protected us 24-7. The other challenge was getting stuff for the babies. I did lay-byes before lockdown at Woolworths Nelspruit, hoping to take them after lockdown, only to find out that they have extended the lockdown. I was then forced to do last-minute shopping and I struggled to find the baby clothes. I’m hoping for them to reopen so that I can get enough clothes for my twins,” said Lekhuleni. Her advice to other mothers who are having babies during this time is just to stay positive and have faith in our health practitioners. They are there to assist us.
