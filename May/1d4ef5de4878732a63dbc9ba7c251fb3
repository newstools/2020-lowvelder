 MBOMBELA – The South African government has put systems in place to provide for the needy, but they can not always feed everyone. Two Mbombela women, Toy Bester and Thea Rix, have taken it upon themselves to help by handing out food parcels. Bester started distributing food parcels five years ago in Middelburg. She then moved to Mbombela and continued helping the needy.

Thea Rix collects food to distribute it to the needy of Mbombela. Thea Rix is the chairlady of CMR Nelspruit and joined Bester in 2018. “It is the love that we have for people that pushes us to give. We cannot see people hungry and suffering. We cannot help with money, but we can supply them with food,” they said. They mainly donate in the Mbombela area, as they are limited by distance. “Petrol comes from our own pockets,” they said. Rix and Bester have limited donations, so cannot distribute too widely. This is done without any funding from the government or bigger organisations. “We rely on the local community for help and support.” Toy Bester donates food parcels and clothing to those in need in Mbombela. The duo have been able to help, but since the lockdown they have been overwhelmed with requests for food, household items and clothes. They have donated to over 350 people since the pandemic began. They also give out unwanted clothing items, jobs and a home to stay in. You can contact Toy Bester on 081-438-5373 and Thea Rix on 082-771-2889.
