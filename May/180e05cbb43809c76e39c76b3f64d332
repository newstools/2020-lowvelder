 Eian Harry Grobbelaar was born on April 2 at Rob Ferreira Hospital. He weighed 2,4kg and was 49 cm long. Having a baby during lockdown was difficult for Nadia Alberts, who experienced complications during birth.  “We have been praying to God for a while, asking him to bless us with a baby. Then it was prophesied that our baby is on the way. A week later I took a pregnancy test and it showed that I was pregnant. Eian is a Hebrew name and it means that God is gracious.

He passed away four  years and five months ago,” Nadia says.  “For me, being a mother means raising my boy to the best of my ability according to the Word of God, so that when Jesus returns my son can go home.” ALSO READ: Meet lockdown baby Zane “Due to how difficult giving birth was, I have developed a phobia of having a second child.
