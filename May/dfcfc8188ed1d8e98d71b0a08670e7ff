 The patient is currently being treated in hospital. “Since the beginning of March, Mediclinic Nelspruit has performed 429 tests and only two patients have tested positive,” said Dr Stefan Smuts, chief clinical officer of Mediclinic Southern Africa. Mediclinic Nelspruit has implemented the necessary measures to quarantine any patients who test positive with the virus and prevent any potential transmission in the hospital, in accordance with National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) and National Department of Health protocols.

We encourage anyone experiencing signs and symptoms of the disease, such as shortness of breath, fever, sore throat, coughing or who believe that that they may have been exposed to the virus, to contact their healthcare provider,” Smuts said.
