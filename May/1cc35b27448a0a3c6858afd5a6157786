The municipality ensured that each and every bus was thoroughly sanitised so Buscor could ferry its passengers in safety. “We are thankful to the municipality, under the leadership of the executive mayor Cllr Sibusiso Mathonsi, for coming on board and help us sanitise our buses before we begin our normal operations.
