 These include Hoërskool Rob Ferreira, Hoërskool Nelspruit, Bergvlam, Uplands College, Hoërskool Lydenburg and Curro, to name a few high schools and Laerskool Laeveld, Laerskool Nelspruit, Nelspruit Primary and Laerskool Witrivier, among others. This week was dedicated to mopping up and finalising all outstanding matters before learners return. “The world we left behind on March 18, is not the same as the world we are going into on Monday. The health and safety aspect of the schooling environment has been a hotly debated subject over the past couple of weeks. I want to reassure parents and learners that Lowveld High is doing all we can to put measures in place to safeguard the learners and the staff against the spread of the virus.

Uplands College head, Heidi Rea, said the school has procured all the necessary PPE, sanitised venues and removed many desks from classrooms to ensure social distancing is in place. “All staff members have already completed virtual Covid-19 readiness training. This week, all staff are also required to attend a compulsory training day in person, where we will work through all the protocols in meticulous detail. Key measures are all in place, including additional facilities for humble hand washing, as Ramaphosa mentioned in his national address. “As Uplands has a number of international boarders who are unable to return at present, we will continue with our remote learning programme, in addition to the face-to-face classroom teaching. Currently, boarding at Uplands remains closed for the remainder of the term. We will make use of time during the upcoming holidays to ensure the necessary boarding protocols are put in place for term three, once permission is granted for this. Uplands looks forward to the resumption of face-to-face teaching over time, as our pupils are the very heartbeat of our school and are greatly missed on campus,” Rea concluded. Executive head of Curro Nelspruit, Mike Bownes, said that staff returned to school on Monday, and are absolutely committed to putting the safety of their community first while ensuring they complete the academic year.  “Our remote teaching and learning have most definitely kept the learners up to date – especially matrics,” he said and added that all PPE and thermometers have arrived, deep cleaning is done and screening stations set up. “We have also trained staff around Covid-19 and occupational health and safety protocols, both online with videos or on-campus with our support staff,” he said. “The safety of our pupils and staff is of paramount importance. We are excited to welcome the grade sevens back on Monday, and we are proud to say that 87 per cent of the remaining pupils who are yet to start is actively participating in online teaching. The whole school has been sanitised and disinfected, and all PPE has been acquired. Mopani Pharmacy has been kind enough to sponsor each child and staff member with a mask which will be worn at all times, classes will be sanitised twice a day and strict access control, to mention a few, have been implemented. We will also practice social distancing, and classes will not exceed 24 pupils per class. Our main priority is to keep everyone safe and leave no child behind. We wish to thank every single parent who remained loyal and paid their school fees. Please keep children and staff at the schools in your prayers,” said Spanner van der Mescht, SGB chairperson of Laerskool Laeveld Covid-19 regulations stipulate that a person leaving their home must wear a mask. It is compulsory to wear a mask at school. Wearing it is not comfortable; for that reason, the appeal is to parents to have their children practise wearing it for extended periods at home. Knowing what to do and what is unacceptable is vital. • Make sure you have a mask that fits properly. It must completely cover your mouth and nose.
• Practice correctly putting on and removing your mask at home. Touch only the elastic bands or strings, but do not touch the mask itself on the inside.
• Practice proper hygiene at home. Wash your hands properly and correctly. Cough and sneeze into the inside of your elbow.
• Practice social distancing of
1,5 metres. No physical contact such as hugs.
• Eat a healthy diet and maintain good sleeping habits. Medical screening of the learner will take place. This means:
• Taking the temperature of the learner with an appropriate instrument.
• Completing a questionnaire that may include the symptoms the learner could be presenting.
• Supervision and monitoring
of physical distancing of at least
1,5 metres between learners.
What will be different at school?
• No assemblies in the school hall. Virtual assemblies on the whiteboard in the classroom.
• No changing of classrooms at the end of lessons.
• Alternating breaks – not everyone at the same time.
• Bring your own bottle of drinking water from home.
• No games involving groups or with the use of equipment, like for instance balls.
• Bring your own supply of paper tissues. • The learner will be denied access to the school premises and the parent or guardian will be required to return the child to their home.
• Should the learner be at school when he or she presents Covid-19 symptoms, he or she will be isolated to prevent any danger to any other learners or to members of staff.
• If the learner is not wearing a face mask, he or she will be issued with one.
• The parents or guardians of the learner will immediately be informed of the situation.
• The school will inform the appropriate health official or contact the Covid-19 helpline on 0800-02-9999. ALSO READ: Passion and hard work lead to academic honours for young scientist
