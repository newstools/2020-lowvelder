The national director of the Vehicle Testing Association (VTA), Julian Pillay, indicated that many of its members have already implemented all of the required measures. Physical inspections and certification have been concluded and stations are ready to start operations. In Mbombela the only station which could be reached for comment and a visit, was the Produkta Vehicle Testing station in Riverside. Manager, Natasja van Staden, confirmed that they have been certified and although there is a limitation on the number of tests per day, they are eager to get busy again. “My biggest concern though, is whether the eNatis system will be operational.” It would thus be wise, she suggested, to contact them on 013-757-5300 to confirm this before you visit the station.
