 The distribution was part of a effort to support families in the communities of Bhekiswako, Makoko, Salubindza and Nyongane villages. Families were identified with the help of Chief Isaac Mdluli.  Mdluli Safari Lodge is located in the south-western region of the Kruger National Park (KNP) and is a partnership between the Mdluli royal family and community, and Grovest Corporate Advisory. The lodge opened on January 15, 2020.  After a long journey of land restitution, the Mdluli community has a freehold title of 850 hectares of land inside the borders of the KNP. This luxurious private safari lodge was developed with the purpose of sustainably uplifting the lives and infrastructure of the 45 000-strong Mdluli community.  According to Chief Isaac Mdluli, the community is really struggling as a result of the nationwide lockdown.  “Unemployment was already high and now even more people have lost their jobs or cannot go to work because businesses are closed. As a chief, I am really close to the community and I could help to identify the families who are in the greatest need of assistance. I know that these food parcels are making a huge difference in their lives,” he said. For more information contact  Mdluli Safari Lodge on their website or Facebook page.
