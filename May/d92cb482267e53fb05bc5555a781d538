 MBOMBELA – Since the introduction of the Solidarity Fund during lockdown, many South Africans have been unsure about the organisation and what purpose it serves as the country took up the fight against the Covid-19 coronavirus. In a bid to provide more clarity, the Solidarity Fund has released a statement to provide a succinct explanation of the role it plays. The statement reads: “The Solidarity Fund’s sole mandate is to support the national health response, contribute to humanitarian relief efforts and mobilise South Africans to drive a united response to the coronavirus pandemic.

This misconception has led to a misunderstanding of exactly what the fund’s mandate entails.
