 “We, in this pandemic of Covid-19, decided to name him Akhokuhle (Creative beautiful things) Bokamoso (Future)  hoping that that we will fight this pandemic and he’s going to have a brighter future,” said proud mother, Elsie Monalee.  Akhokuhle Bokamkso Khoza was born at Themba Hospital during the lockdown and weighed 3,5kg. “Being a mother changed my life. I’m enjoying it even though it’s not easy. I have to wake up in the middle of the night and breastfeed.” “Having a baby during lockdown was challenging. We hired a car to take me to Themba Hospital and I went there with my mother and my sister. When we arrived at the hospital main gate they only allowed my mother and I to enter. This was so that my mother could open the admission file and then she had to leave again.  I gave birth around 01:15 and I called her to come and fetch me around 14:00. The worst part of it all was that I was not prepared. My baby didn’t have clothes and the shops were closed . All we could do is wrap my baby in a blanket. I could only buy baby clothes two weeks ago.”  “The advice I can give to other mothers who are having babies during this difficult time is to buy baby clothes in advance. They must be prepared that they are going to be alone during labour because the hospital does not allow other people, so they have to be strong.” ALSO READ: Meet baby Lizandri “The worst part of it is that I’m unemployed I should have bought the clothes in time, so mothers who are employed should prepare everything before labour”.
