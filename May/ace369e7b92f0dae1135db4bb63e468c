It was short, convenient and less painful. The doctor made sure I was relaxed and took the samples, so people must not be scared to test when they present the symptoms or have been in contact with someone who is infected,” said the Premier. The co-chairpersons of the Command Center, Mpumalanga SAPS Provincial Commissioner, Lt-General Mondli Zuma commended the officials for setting a good example by participating in the testing process. “We have observed with concern the reluctance of some of our communities to be tested during our meetings, for fear of stigmatization. Some end up absconding quarantine procedures. To self-isolate or to be quarantined is not a punishment but to help those who tested positive and to curb the rising number of infections,” said Lt General Zuma. Provincial Government will continue to educate the public about the benefits of screening and testing for coronavirus.
