 The needy are in a much worse state, as they can not do anything to make ends meet. There is a hero on its way to help out those in need in this trying time. Pediatric Care Africa is a non-profit organisation that provides life-saving assistance and hope to less fortunate children in local communities and throughout Africa. They assist children with medical treatment, surgeries, baby food and so on, but with the Covid-19 pandemic, they also assist adults and the elderly with food parcels. Today they are starting the distribution of the eNCA and HCI Foundation Lunchbox Fund food parcel deliveries, with the help of a few volunteers. The eMedia Covid-19 Relief Fund, in partnership with the HCI Foundation, helps to eliminate starvation for countless vulnerable communities in South Africa by providing them with food relief during the Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdown. Pediatric Care Africa is also accepting any donations of food. The donations can be dropped off at Pick and Pay White River into the trolley at the entrance, or at their offices in Plaston Road. Larger donations can be collected by them at any donorâ€™s premises or can be delivered to their stores. ALSO READ: Spar donates food for flights
