 MBOMBELA – Just three weeks ago, the Department of Social Services revised the grants pay-out dates and announced that the disability and older person’s grant will now be paid on the fourth day of each month, with all other grants to be paid from the sixth of every month. This move, according to the department, is designed to help decrease the long queues and enforce social distancing.
“Well, today I am happy that all the pensioners here are wearing masks, but I am not impressed by the fact that the social distancing isn’t obeyed by pensioners at most of our pay points. MEC Thandi Shongwe helps direct pensioners. “This is really a cause for concern, but we will continue to preach this gospel until it sinks in,” said MEC Thandi Shongwe, who visited a number of pay-points and interacted with pensioners.

Hungry and tired pensioners wait in long queues for their grants. “I think we (government) need to pursue other avenues to administer these grants, such as using spaza shops and township supermarkets. We have to look at all possible avenues that would help us shorten the queues and make this experience a lot easier for our grannies.” ALSO READ: Spotting in KNP continues despite Covid-19 lockdown
