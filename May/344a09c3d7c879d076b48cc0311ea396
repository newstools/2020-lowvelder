 SDI is a services-on-demand platform which gives micro-suppliers access to large corporate entities. When these entities make use of their services, the micro-suppliers benefit in that employment is created. And this gave rise to the SDI Force, a group of skilled people who have been helping the homeless in the Johannesburg area by providing support, food packs, sanitiser, and other essentials.  The SDI Force has to date handed out over 7,430 food packs equating to 407,500 single meal servings. The demand for their assistance has now however increased to the point where South Africans are being asked to contribute in order to help expand their efforts. The SDI Force allows up to 50 000 skilled persons to play a role in assisting the vulnerable during these unprecedented times. According to a statement, the initiative realised that its micro-suppliers could play an important role in the delivery of many critical services. These services will help South Africans win the war against the virus on both the medical and socio-economic fronts.  SDI has various platforms including Loadit, Tradeway, Sweepsouth, and Aweh Africa. Loadit facilitates transport services between customers and drivers through an app, while Sweep South is an on-demand cleaning app. Tradeway is a promotions company which focuses on creating connected brand experiences, and Aweh Africa specialises in providing people with field interviewer skills for the collection of marketing information. Those involved in the initiative said they have noticed that being confined to their homes is impacting all South Africans – even more so when their livelihoods are compromised. Waste collectors, traffic light traders and car guards all play an integral role in society, and the lockdown has left many of them without their daily source of income. Realising that if it didn’t step forward to assist, many people, and especially those in vulnerable groups, might not survive the coronavirus threat and lockdown, the SDI Force has now broadened its scope to focus on a more national level, including the elderly and other vulnerable groups, such as those at risk of dying from starvation, exposure, and malnutrition. In order to further empower both micro-suppliers and the greater South Africa, co-founders of the initiative Andile Ramaphosa and Brad Fisher have now partnered with the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, the Department of Social Development and the City of Joburg in collaboration with Gauteng Acting MEC for Social Development, Panyaza Lesufi. “The SDI does not handle funds itself. These are handled by the Unity Values NGO and all relevant legal requirements have been met,” said Brad Aigner, IS HE WITH THE NGO? who works closely with the SDI. – Spread the word, and not the virus.
– For the moment, the focus is on essentials such as food and hygiene products. Those who want to assist can visit the Unity Values website.
– All packs will be distributed daily throughout the national lockdown by government-approved distribution and logistics agents.
– The SDI Force and the ADreach Group have partnered with Unity Values in launching an auditable online fundraising initiative to purchase food and hygiene packs for those in need.
– Every R1 000 donated helps feed a family for three weeks. The ADreach Group (investor and stakeholder in SDI) has already pledged R50 000 and is now challenging other companies and the public to donate. This can be done on the Unity Values website. The SDI Force appeals to the public to contribute and use their social media network to garner far-reaching support for this initiative. “We can all play our part in helping our country through this pandemic. While the virus has brought about significant physical constraints, it must not be allowed to constrain our humanity. If ever there was a time for us to stick together, to help others, it is now. We must do more and care more as, after all, we are one nation,” concluded the statement. Do your part to help, and act now. *Notice: Coronavirus reporting at Caxton Local Media aims to combat fake news Dear reader,
