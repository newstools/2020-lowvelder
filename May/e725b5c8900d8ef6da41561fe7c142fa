 Many community members have taken to the Kruger National Park’s Twitter page to share their feelings of longing for the Kruger National Park (KNP), and say they cannot wait to visit once the restrictions have been lifted. South Africans come to the KNP from near and far, and all for the same reason. The KNP runs in every South African’s blood. A long, leisurely drive with the windows down, spotting wild with loved ones, has become something of a family tradition for most.
