 According to race convener, Brian Rossouw, this year’s edition saw a marked increase in the number of participants, which meant more organisations could be assisted. The race was held from January 30 to February 2nd and was hosted by the Round Table White River 64, which has been involved in the annual spectacle since its inception 46 years ago. “With the increase in participants at the annual Sabie Tube race, it was essential to partner with the right people to ensure the safety of each and every individual over the weekend. “Since Phoenix Security has joined the Sabie Tube Race, we have had little to no incidents and if something popped up, it was dealt with effectively and professionally. In return for the great service provided, they asked that we assist our local animal shelters,” said Rossouw. ALSO READ: Don’t give hackers a pass.

Round Table White River 64 also donated R5 000 towards NCF, so food would be distributed to people in need,” he concluded.
