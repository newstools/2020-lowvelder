 I would add – until one has loved a child – to this. Our animal shelters are forever wrestling to save those four-, and well, two-legged animals and pets that are so easily abandoned when things get tough. And of course now, the Covid-19 pandemic is certainly not helping their efforts. At Pro-Life just outside of Mbombela, owner Karin Erasmus was ecstatic because they have been allowed to open the facility. This includes the clinic.

Two days before the start of lockdown, we received large donations of food and donations and this enabled us to feed our animals and pay our staff. Of course during lockdown, we could not do any fundraising. All our staff are back – the clinic is open and our food stocks are adequate for now but, of course, food donations are always welcome. We have just received permission to reopen our adoption program. So should you wish to adopt, visits for this purpose are by appointment only,” said Karin.  “We have not received inquires from owners wanting to abandon their pets, which is a reassuring. I would however suggest that should an owner struggle, they rather request help in the line of food from friends to feed their animal, instead of simply abandoning it.” It is a known fact that animal companionship during tough times contributes significantly to improve the mental and emotional health of the owners or companions.

So Pro-Life are back to “normal”, blessed and grateful and their animals are exuberant.
