 The Kruger National Park (KNP) has found a way to bring the park to nature lovers who long for spotting wild in the park. On SANParks‚Äô website, there are now three options for webcam footage that you can enjoy. These are cameras planted in the wild that take pictures every few minutes. SANParks warned that the updating of these photos may be disrupted from time to time due to bad weather conditions.  This option provides a live feed through various cameras spread out in the park. The website does warn that viewing of the live streams requires high-speed internet. It goes on to explain that if you cannot view the live cams, you will have better luck with the still cams.  These are highlights of great sightings submitted through registered forum users.  According to SANParks‚Äô Twitter page, this tail was spotted earlier on the morning of May 16 on the Punda Maria webcam. Mischief at its best.
