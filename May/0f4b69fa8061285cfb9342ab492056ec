 An increase of up to 50 cents a litre for petrol is expected for June, while diesel is heading in the opposite direction, with a decline of up to 56 cents. This is according to the Automobile Association (AA), based on unaudited mid-month fuel price data released by the Central Energy Fund.

Motorists are also driving far less due to the ongoing lockdown.

This could make South Africans sensitive to even small fuel price increases,” the association commented. It said that the differences between the movements for different fuel prices are likely to be related to imbalances in global refining capacity in the first week of May as the oil industry came to grips with the unprecedented April oversupply and price crashes. It said it expected fuel price volatility to be substantial and long-lasting, as the world economy adjusts to the new reality of a spreading pandemic.
