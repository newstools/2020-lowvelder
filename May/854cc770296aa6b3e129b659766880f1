As a rare sight at the Kruger National Park, a leopard on Monday went for walk on the Skukuza Golf course. The animal was spotted by a camera that had been placed on the golf course. The course must be a favourite exercise spot for the leopard, as it made its first appearance at 12:14 and then returned for a second appearance at 17:56 the same day.  According to the courseâ€™s greenskeeper, Jean Rossouw, the footage was captured as part of a project by the Organisation of Tropical Studies to see what type of animals are roaming the area. Rossouw went on to say that the project would continue even after lockdown has ended.  Photo credit: The Organisation of Tropical Studies
