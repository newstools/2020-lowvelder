 Nadine said, “I’ve carried a child within my body. I’ve slept with her on my chest. I’ve kissed, wiped away tears, and spent sleepless nights cradling her. But I wouldn’t have had it any other way. There is no greater honour, love or blessing”.  Lizandri du Plessis was born on April 7 at Mediclinic Nelspruit, weighing 2,94kg and was 51cm long. “We decided on her name by writing down four of our favourite names and we threw them into a hat, choosing two names and then the final one – Lizandri, ” explained her proud mother.  “Being a mother means the world to me, it means putting my girl first before myself. Caring for her needs and loving her unconditionally! Being a mother is loving someone else more than you love yourself. “ “It was quite interesting to have a baby during lockdown, but very scary though because there is so much uncertainty in what can happen in this time. Also sad because none of the grandparents could have been there, continued Nadine.  “During this lockdown time the most positive thing was bonding time. My husband works shifts, but he got the time to bond with us. Family means everything.“ “Challenges of the lockdown are the uncertainties of the future, while challenges of being a mother are always wondering if you are good enough and how to improve.” “If I had to give any tips to other mothers having a baby during this time, it would be to try and stay calm, for the baby’s sake, and pray. A prayer always helps. Spend as much time as possible with your little one and spouse.“ “Also create a loving environment and enjoy every moment with your baby.” ALSO READ: Meet lockdown baby Zane “Finally mom, always remember you are doing the best you can.”
