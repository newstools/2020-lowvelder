 The majority of the human race always reverts back to Google for all the questions they cannot answer themselves. According to Google Trends, these are the most popular topics searched in South Africa. The numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. Google Trends explained in their help section that a value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term and a value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. A score of 0 means there was not enough data for this term.   Dear reader, As your local news provider, we have the duty of keeping you factually informed on Covid-19 developments.
