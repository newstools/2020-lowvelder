It was another glorious morning in Kruger National Park during lockdown as Jean Rossouw, greenskeeper at Skukuza Golf Course, set out on his morning drive to work like every other morning.  Rossouw started his morning by driving around the course to ensure that it was safe before he started his work day. In the midst of his drive Rossouw came across a pack of hyenas enjoying a morning kill on the golf course and had only just missed the kill itself. They were spotted by Rossouw on the fifth fairway. Rossouw said that he sat back and watched as the pack enjoyed their breakfast and he enjoyed his morning coffee.  Photo and video credit: Jean Rossouw, Skukuza Golf Course
