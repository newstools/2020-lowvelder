 MBOMBELA – SASSA grant recipients will receive payment from June 3rd and 4th for pensioners and persons with disabilities, according to the SASSA Mpumalanga spokesperson, Senzeni Ngubeni. He added that this payment would include linked child grants and added that all other grants would be paid from June 5th. Since the introduction of the R350 social relief grant, only 10 recipients of the millions of unemployed South Africans who had applied, have received any payments.

We must remember that anyone receiving any other form of government assistance such as NSFAS, pension, UIF and insurance, are  not eligible to receive the grant,” said Ngubeni.

This includes directly into bank accounts, via e-wallet or at the post office for beneficiaries without access to phones or bank accounts.”  ALSO READ: Covid-19 lockdown bares the faults in South African society Ngubeni also added that beneficiaries would be paid from the month in which the application was made until October this year, stipulating that no back payments would be made. What this means is that beneficiaries applying later than May when the grant was introduced, would not receive any payments from May when government introduced the social relief grant.
