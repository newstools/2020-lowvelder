 MBOMBELA – During the Easter weekend, there was another attempted break in at the SPCA. One of its employees, Fred van Heerden, came across the perpetrators, scaring them away. Nelspruit SPCA chairperson Lize Pienaar, said that luckily no one got hurt. “After the last couple of months of incidents we were hoping it will end now, at least for a while,” said Pienaar. She says that they seem to steal anything, from shovels and garden equipment, to food (human and animal). They also steal the staff members personal belongings. The SPCA has been struggling with break-ins for months and wants to build a wall around the premises because its fence is damaged every time there is a break-in. As previously reported, the SPCA is near the Ka Nyamazane road and pedestrians create a shorter path to the factories by cutting through the SPCA’s fence.
