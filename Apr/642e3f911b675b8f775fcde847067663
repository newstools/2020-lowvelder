 Jaco Vorster wants to unite people through worship during lockdown. Vorster recently witnessed the power of this in Middelburg, and decided to bring it to Mbombela. He began an evening of worship last Friday, amassing songs on a playlist that he now releases to the public every day. People can now listen to these songs daily to get into the spirit. “We place the playlist on Dropbox, Google Drive and stream online at 18:00 everyday. On WhatsApp I send it as an actual file,” Vorster told Lowvelder. He said, “I just want this to echo through the town so people can worship. Since we started this, we have filled two WhatsApp groups and we are on the third. More than 1 000 people have joined our Facebook page.”  Vorster has received many testimonies about the effect of these worship sessions. From residents believing their prayers have been answered to those saying they are being drawn closer to God.
