 MBOMBELA – The Mpumalanga Provincial Government left no stone unturned at Mbombela taxi rank this morning, in a bid to combat the scourge of the Covid-19 coronavirus.  Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane and the MEC for public works, roads and transport, Gillion Mashego, sanitised taxis and handed over hygiene packs to district municipalities for distribution in all taxi ranks throughout the province. This was to ensure that these public amenities are not breeding grounds for Covid-19, which has claimed lives around the world. “There are many people who still don’t practise social distancing. You still find people in large groups and as a result it becomes hard for the government to curb the spread of covid-19. I am concerned about the safety of people who use taxis to travel. It is important to sanitise taxis. I am here today to educate the commuters to practise social distancing,” says Mtsweni-Tsipane.
