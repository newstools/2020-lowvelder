 Lydia Sono, community builder and winner of Mpumalanga Sunrise Women’s Awards: Humanitarian Category, started the initiative when her friend, Thabang Meyiwa, approached her. “We decided to go out and ask for donations,” Sono told the media. “We managed to raise enough money to buy 30 metres of material and a 14-year-old boy volunteered to sew the masks for us for free.” Sono said that she knew Junior Mbelekwane liked sewing, so she approached him to find out if he wanted to help in the initiative.
