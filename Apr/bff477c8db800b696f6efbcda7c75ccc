 In the pictures taken by Johan Malan from Wildlife Veterinary Services, the lions can be seen patrolling the fence of Skukuza staff village, situated on the southern banks of the Sabie River. It is the park’s largest rest camp and administrative headquarters.

This is indicated by yet another post on Kruger National Park Twitter page, saying that a pride of lions is usually resident on Kempiana Contractual Park, an area Kruger tourists do not see. However, they were spotted lying on the tar road just outside of Orpen Rest Camp – in plain sight during this lockdown period.

According to Barbara Creecy, Minister of Forestry and Fisheries and Environmental Affairs of the Republic of South Africa, rhino poaching numbers have decreased in South Africa during the Covid-19 time. “This could be attributed to the dedication of the essential staff who are on high alert in the Kruger Park, all other national parks, as well as provincial and municipal game reserves,” said Creecy.
