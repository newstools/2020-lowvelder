 Applications for the Department of Tourism’s Tourism Relief Fund opened on April 7 and will continue until May 30. Established as an intervention to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 coronavirus on the tourism sector, the R200-million fund provides a once-off capped grant to small, micro and medium sized enterprises (SMMEs) to ensure sustainability during and after the implementation of the nationwide lockdown.

We hope the support offered through the Tourism Relief Fund will assure the continued survival of SMMEs beyond the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Kubayi-Ngubane. Linda Grimbeek, COO of the Kruger Lowveld Chamber of Business and Tourism (KLCBT), said they “welcome this fund which is specifically created to assist the small tourism businesses”. Capped at R50 000 per entity, the grant funding can be utilised to subsidise expenses towards fixed costs, operational costs, supplies and other pressure cost items. Grimbeek said the fund only assists exempted micro enterprises, which means businesses of under R5 million per annum in the tourism industry. “We are very concerned that these small businesses are not necessarily registered as companies, or that they will have financial statements in place to give as proof. “We are also concerned that they may not be able to access six months’ bank statements which usually requires a trip to the bank and a waiting period of five days. We do however encourage all businesses to try and access any funding they can possibly apply for.” According to her, for businesses of such a small size, R50 000 relief might mean they can at least pay staff for another month or maybe two. “We do not know when the lockdown in SA, let alone our core markets in the rest of the world, will be lifted, and our main aim right now should be to retain staff. “We further appeal to business owners who do get access to any funding, to apply it to retain as many staff as possible. Negotiate with other creditors and banks for down payment of bills later during the recovery period. Rent is one of those examples that you certainly can talk about. “We are all in the same boat, and landlords are not likely to kick you out or put another tenant in your place at short notice. Don’t hide, talk! Do not let bills fall behind and then try to reason with creditors. Do it before you lapse on payments. Please do not be greedy, use the funding to ensure the survival of your business and to retain jobs, not just your own household expenses,” she said.
