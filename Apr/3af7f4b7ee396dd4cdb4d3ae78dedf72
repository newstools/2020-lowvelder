 An charity, Intervention for non-SA SME in RSA, has chosen to provide for international citizens who are not currently being catered for. Due to the lockdown, many local residents are unable to carry on with the daily activities that would ensure their income. Vee Modieleng, a member of the intiative, told Lowvelder, “We are a group of people who are aware that many immigrants depend on a daily income for survival. During this period, they cannot make an income. With the extension of the lockdown, many families will eventually go hungry. We are doing our bit to make sure that even if we do not reach everyone, we reduce the number of those in need.” ALSO READ: Minister of police promises swift action against illegal liquor traders The initiative started on Friday, April 10, and they have received requests for help from across the country. They have a simple screening process to ensure they only help those who need it. Modieleng said, “When they call, we ask them to send a picture of their passport as proof of their nationality. We check the passport’s validity and then provide them with a food voucher, which they can use to purchase food at supermarkets including Shoprite, Checkers and uSave.” She noted the number of calls they have received has doubled in the past two days as word spreads. The team’s priority is mothers with children. Modieleng commented, “We have assisted as much as we can and we really want to do more. Now we must call on those who have the capacity to join us in helping those who cannot help themselves during this period. No one should go hungry.” ALSO READ: Still some movement in Barberton streets despite Covd-19 lockdown Those interested in donating towards this good cause can contact the charity on 011-338-6029 for further details.
