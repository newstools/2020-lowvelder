Social distancing remains one of the best weapons we have to slow the silent spread of the coronavirus which causes the COVID-19 infection. By putting enough distance between you and other people, you not only ensure your own safety, but that of your community and the health care professionals who are working tirelessly to keep our nation alive and well. If you feel anxious or powerless against this impending threat, know that the fact that you have stayed at home already means you are a reliable soldier in this war against the disease. If you do need to venture out for essentials, make sure you maintain at least two metres  space between you and other people at all times. Do this, and you can be sure to add your name to the list of fighters against COVID-19.  What’s more, is that social distancing means that far less people will get infected, so those who need medical care will be able to receive it, rather than be turned away from overcrowded hospitals. It is important for all of us to observe social distancing protocols. Although young and healthy people carry a quite low chance of death, they are still considered carriers, and can pass the virus on to others. So take up the fight, stay at home and keep your distance!
