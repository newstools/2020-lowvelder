During the time of lockdown, every South African yearns for a long drive with the windows open spotting wildlife in Kruger National Park. However Kruger is closed and we are confined to our homes and neighbourhoods. Do not be discouraged, because there is a light at the end of the tunnel. During these unprecedented times Mala Mala Game Reserve, situated in Mpumalanga close to the Kruger National Park, has come up with quite a positive solution. They began to think outside the box and decided that if their guests cannot visit them, they will bring the game reserve to their guests. According to Pieter van Wyk, ranger and social media manager for Mala Mala Game Reserve, they started a series – Rangers in Isolation – to serve their guests who could not visit the Game Reserve. They take game drives daily, sometimes even twice a day, and film them for all animal lovers to watch. According to Van Wyk, their camps are closed but they still have a small dedicated team who will, in the coming weeks, share everything from game drives to field work in the Rangers in Isolation series. “These are challenging times and our thoughts are with you and your families wherever you may be. Take care of each other, be responsible and stay safe. This too shall pass and when it does, we’ll be waiting to share the magic of Mala Mala with you in person,” said Van Wyk. Videos and photos of all their game drives, and specifically the Rangers in isolation, series can be found on their YouTube and other social media channels. During the coming weeks we will share the journey of Mala Mala Game Reserve Rangers with our readers. This will include the Rangers in Isolation series, animals seen and rare sightings.
