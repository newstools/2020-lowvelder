According to a media statement issued by the office of the provincial commissioner: Mpumalanga, three suspects, aged between 31 and 35, were arrested at Ekulindeni in the early hours of April 27. They were acting as Covid-19 officials on deployment, in an attempt to cover their criminal activities. According to the report, a team of police officials received information about two vehicles which were branded with Covid-19 insignia, but allegedly participating in criminal activities.

Upon stopping the vehicles, police found three occupants pretending to be Covid-19 officials.
