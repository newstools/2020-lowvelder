 According to the police report, the vehicles allegedly belong to a tavern owner, who, along with two other drivers, was arrested for not complying with the national lockdown regulations and the restrictions on the movement of liquor. A statement by the Mpumalanga police read: “In line with the SAPS anti-corruption strategy, the national commissioner, Gen Khehla Sitole, has sanctioned urgent departmental investigations into the two incidents through which, if found guilty, the members could face dismissal from the service.”  In light of this, the minister of police, Bheki Cele has called a meeting with SAPS management and liquor retailers in a bid to nip such acts in the bud. Cele warned that anyone found contravening the lockdown regulations would be dealt with decisively. “The general crime picture since the Covid-19 lockdown continues to reflect a decrease, and such incidents must therefore be intercepted and the perpetrators arrested. Our law-abiding citizens must continue to work with law enforcement against criminals as we together ensure the survival of the human race during Covid-19,” he said.
