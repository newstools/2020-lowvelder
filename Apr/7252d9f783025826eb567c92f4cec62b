 Volkswagen has just announced its first steps towards electric mobility in South Africa. The e-Golf project will make six fully electric Golfs available for testing by the media, selected dealers in Gauteng, the Western Cape and VW employees. The intention is to gain insight into the varying experiences. The e-Golfs will be used as shuttles and courtesy cars. “At Volkswagen, we want to democratise electric mobility, and that is why the e-Golf pilot project is a key initiative for the brand. With the help of our dealers, we want to get as many South Africans as possible to drive and experience an electric vehicle, as this is the future of our brand,” said Mike Glendinning, sales and marketing director for Volkswagen Group South Africa.
