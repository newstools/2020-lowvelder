During lockdown our furry friends at Pro-Life Pet Rescue are being taken care of by a number of staff living on site. Access to the facility has been prohibited since end of March and only emergency veterinary care is allowed.  No adoptions or public  visits have been possible since the start of the lockdown period and the main source of revenue for staff and other day-to-day costs have been severed. Lowvelder together with BUCO Nelspruit have initiated the Owner and Pet Lookalike competition to raise funds for Pro-Life. By taking part you stand a chance of winning one of a number of product hampers for you and your pet. Some Examples: How to enter*: 1. Go to the Owner and Pet Lookalike post on our Facebook page
2. Comment with your name/surname contact number and a fun photo of your pet and yourself. Remember this is a owner and pet lookalike competition!
