Jaco Klopper, an environmentalist, and his wingman, Victor Morton, were going about their daily duties when they heard a dog cry from afar. Klopper explained the last day they were on the particular route was five days ago. The dog must have been ensnared after they left.  The dog stayed in the bush without food or water for those five days. Klopper told Lowvelder, “Victor and I were on our daily patrol just around Hazyview, when we heard the cry of a dog about 5 kilometres away from where we were. We initially thought it was dogs playing, however the noise was continuous.  So we went back along the trail to search for it.” It took several hours of their time to rescue the dog. “It took us over an hour to find the dog. When we eventually found it, it took us a while to get it to trust us enough that we to get close to it. Only after that did we start to detangle the snare around its neck and feet, which took lots of time too,” he explained. He said getting the dog to trust them was important, as a scared dog may try to move, which only tightens the snare. However, they do their best to free the dog unharmed. After the dog was freed it got up and ran away. Klopper confirmed the dog is one of four dogs that belonged to a farmer around the area. Video credit: Jaco Klopper Photo credit: Jaco Klopper
