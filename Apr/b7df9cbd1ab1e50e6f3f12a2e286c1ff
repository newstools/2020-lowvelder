 “For those customers where value for money, reliability and safety are the primary purchase considerations, you cannot go wrong with a Figo,” said Doreen Mashinini, general manager for marketing of Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. “The Figo represents the entry point to the Ford brand for our local customers,” she continued. “It is ideal for anyone who prioritises impressive fuel economy and low running costs, but without compromising on comfort, safety features, driving dynamics and, of course, good looks. But you don’t have to take my word for it.” “Three out of the 10 best-selling cars in South Africa right now are Ford vehicles, with the fabulous little Figo right there among them. Numbers don’t lie. More than a thousand Figos found new homes last month. And more than a thousand customers can’t be wrong.” ALSO READ: Mixed emotions about lockdown in KaNyamazane For those who want to really stand out from the crowd, Ford has introduced the striking Figo Blu. With its distinctive sporty Blu package, it is quite the head-turner. Based on the 1.5 Trend hatchback model, the Figo Blu can easily be distinguished from the standard Figo by a number of model-specific styling enhancements. Most noticeably, the exterior sports a black roof, black mesh grille, black mirror housings, and black multi-spoke 15-inch alloy wheels, with eye-catching blue accents, inside and out. All five-door hatchback and four-door sedan models, including the Figo Blu, are powered by Ford’s latest-generation 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine, endowed with 88kW power.
