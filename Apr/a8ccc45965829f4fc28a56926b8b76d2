 Gosher is not new to goodwill in aviation, as he also started the Children’s Flight initiative a few years ago, where children who have never flown in an aeroplane before, are taken for a flip from one of the Gauteng airports.

Gosher quickly realised that the Covid-19 pandemic will have a detrimental effect on marginalised communities and started The Covid Flight. All aviators from the Children’s and Elderly Flights pledged their support for The Covid Flight. This support includes the use of their own aircraft and the necessary fuel for the relief flights. One of these pilots is Charles Fuller. He owns a house in Mbombela and, with Marike van Coppenhagen in Centurion, heads up The Covid Flight in the Lowveld.
