Tracy Todd Heine has completed a social media marketing course through the University of Cape Town, and is proud of herself. She started the nine-week online course with the intention of helping small businesses in Mbombela to build an online presence and market themselves through social media. Heine told Lowvelder, “Ultimately the goal is to assist small businesses. Sadly due to the global pandemic of Covid-19, I do not know what to expect for now. I will watch and wait to see what will happen after the lockdown. I will be able to help businesses get back on their feet after this period.” On completing her course a day ago, she expressed her excitement on Facebook. She posted her module marks and the lessons she had learned along her journey.
