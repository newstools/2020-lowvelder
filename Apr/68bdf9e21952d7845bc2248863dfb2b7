The cameras are not originally set up to detect animals, but have since been updated. Photo taken on Malcolm Easton’s farm. Pieter du Preez, a farmer south of the Da Gama Dam, also found some paw prints on his farm, but this was last week Tuesday. Dr Ferreira du Plessis, from the MTPA, said they first became aware of the lion last week Thursday. He said all reports at this stage point to it being only one lion.

The first priority will be to dart the lion when it is found. Different situations require different solutions and Du Plessis said there are many factors. Two main factors would be the nature of the terrain where the lion is found, and also its behaviour.

Du Plessis said this is to “neutralise the lion’s GPS” and to examine him. During this time they can then decide what would be best for the lion; to go to the Kruger National Park or perhaps another reserve.
