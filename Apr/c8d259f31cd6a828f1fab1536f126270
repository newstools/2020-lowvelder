 Customers have the opportunity to send in their grocery lists by email or on WhatsApp, and the store will shop on their behalf. Once the order is ready, customers get a notification to go and collect it. The store brings the groceries out to the vehicle, and payments may be made on a speedpoint (cash transactions are unfortunately not available), without having to leave the safety of the parking lot. “We felt the need to make the shopping process both easier and safer for our customers,” said Ettiene Hoffmann, a manager. Customers can order by sending an email to pnpmalelaneorders@gmail.com or sending a WhatsApp message to 063-481-7693.

As another way of donating, shoppers may “add extra rand” to their till slips, by asking the cashier when checking items out. A donation of only R21 can provide a person in need with one meal a day for a week. Customers can also convert their Smart Shopper points on the Pick n Pay app and donate them to FoodForward SA, or donate online through JAM SA and FoodForward SA.
