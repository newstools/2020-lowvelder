Ford’s Roadside Assistance programme, provided by the AA and applicable for a period of three years from the date of purchase of a new vehicle, remains operational throughout the national lockdown. Customers that experience a breakdown can contact the AA on 0861-150-250 and, if necessary, a recovery unit will be dispatched to assist the customer.
