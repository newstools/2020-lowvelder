 The Provincial Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure is calling on communities to comply with regulations and amendments in relation to Covid-19. The structure also urges the community to refrain from attacking law-enforcement agencies while enforcing the regulations aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19. Two incidents occurred in Kwaggafontein and Waterval Boven. Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant General Mondli Zuma, who also co-chairs the structure, warned the public against such behaviour. “We will not hesitate to arrest people who intentionally attack law-enforcement officers enforcing the Covid-19 regulations and the lockdown. We urge communities to work with the law-enforcement agencies to fight this pandemic,” said Zuma.
