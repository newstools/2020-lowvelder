This appeal came on Monday after a number of residents in the Nkomazi sub-region and Bushbuckridge refused to be screened by healthcare workers. “I understand that this is all new to our people, but it is vital that they allow our officials to screen them. Many people, through social media, were made to believe that they would contract the virus if they were screened. I want to assure them that the test and screening is quite simple. “Our officials only ask a few questions about your latest movements or visits and then scan you with a digital scanner to see your temperature level. So we appeal to everyone to work with us so we can beat the spread of the virus.” Manzini, who officially launched the provincial leg of the home visits on Monday in Agincourt, Bushbuckridge, led from the front as she joined a team of healthcare workers doing home visits. She revealed that the first two patients diagnosed with Covid-19 have recovered while 19 others were responding well. “This is proof that if we work together we can defeat this virus,” she said. She also commended the healthcare workers for obeying President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call to conduct home visits.
