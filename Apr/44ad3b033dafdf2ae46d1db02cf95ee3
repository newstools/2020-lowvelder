 Standing at over 828 meters high and with 160 storeys, Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world. It also has the largest lighting display, with more than 100 000 m2 of LED screens. This incredible light display was used to honour South Africans yesterday, on 27 April, on the annual commemoration of Freedom Day. Like a beacon of hope for South Africa in these unprecedented times, the Burj Khalifa honoured South Africa by using their incredible lighting display to create a South African flag covering the worldâ€™s tallest building. A representative from the United Arab Emirates said on their Twitter Page that they wanted to take the opportunity to extend their very best wishes to South Africa on Freedom Day, by echoing the message of â€˜Solidarity and triumph of the human spirit in these challenging timesâ€™. They added that they wanted to honour the legacy of Nelson Mandela and his struggle for the freedom of his people. This, they said, is how they raise the people they love on the highest peak of human construction. The Department of International Relations and Cooperation said via their Twitter page that they wanted to thank the United Arab Emirates and its people for this great testament to unity between South Africa and the Emirates.
