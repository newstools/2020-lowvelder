We deal with problems as they come.” Shaun Terblanche, the manager of J&M Security, said, “We are working as usual with our clients. We are also working with the White River police to ensure residents abide by the lockdown regulations.” ALSO READ: National Lottery takes players’ safety into consideration Wahl Bartmann, the CEO of the Fidelity Services Group, said in a press release, “The Fidelity Services Group is considered an exempt and essential service in terms of the announcement.
