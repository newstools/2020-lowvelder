 Lex Hollmann, owner of Malelane SUPERSPAR, informed the public on Tuesday that the store will be closed for 14 days. The perishable food; some fruit and vegetables as well as some of the dairy products; were donated to a few of the local charities as well as families in need. Over 150 families in the KaMhlushwa, Marloth Park and Malalane areas received the goods. The total cost of the food that was given away was around R110 000. “As for the meat – we have placed the products with a short shelf life back in the freezer,” Hollmann said. The Department of Labour visited the store on Monday and notified Hollmann that he should send all of his staff home to quarantine after two cases of Covid-19 coronavirus were confirmed in the store. One was a woman working in the Bureau de Change kiosk and the other was a man who had travelled with her, and is an outside merchandiser based in the store.

He sent out a message stating, “We really appreciate all the offers of help that have come in after my last Facebook post. The Department of Health is in the process of testing our staff. Once tested they all have to go home and self-isolate for 14 days. “Included here are our management staff, who are key to running our business smoothly. As a family, we have decided that the correct course of action is to close the store for 14 days. This is not a decision that has been taken lightly, but has been taken with everyone’s best interests at heart. We look forward to serving our community with our continued commitment when we are able to reopen.” The store will be open to the public again on April 21. “Until then we thank everyone for their support, and we look forward to seeing everyone in the store again,” Hollmann concluded.
