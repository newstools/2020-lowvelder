 Steyn Fourie streams lockdown concerts from his home via WatchaTV on Saturday evenings at 17:00. Fourie told Lowvelder, “I was thinking out of the box on a way to entertain people at home. And so last week I hosted the first show and the attendance and feedback was great”.  WatchaTV allows Fourie to provide the audience with an exciting live show with great video quality. He sings both Afrikaans and English songs for the audience attending his concert online. The next concert will be held tomorrow at 17:00. Tickets are R40 for a 40-minute live concert.

Fourie is an Afrikaans singer and songwriter who has a very close connection to the Lowveld.  In 1991 he won the national song competition called “Debut” and was crowned as the best singer in South Africa. “Pennies op die spoor”, written by Stef Kruger, is one of the songs which made Steyn famous. “I am a people’s person and I will continue to make this live concert fun. I will also show people how to braai snoek during one of the concerts,” he added.
