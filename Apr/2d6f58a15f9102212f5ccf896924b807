 Russel Meiring, ER24 spokesperson, said, “Incidents at home occur regularly, lockdown or no lockdown. We’ve seen some incidents where children have been involved in incidents at home, not only at the swimming pool. This could be because children are spending a lot more time at home and sometimes may not be supervised appropriately.” He continued, “If you do have the option of working from home, it is important to ensure that your children are supervised at all times. If you are an essential worker and can’t be at home, adult supervision should still be enforced at home.” ER24 shared tips to keep the children safe around the swimming pool: ALSO READ: Community Can Challenge reaches finish line on first door-to-door delivery ALSO READ: Preparations underway to reopen Malelane SUPERSPAR ER24 advises individuals to familiarise themselves with the emergency numbers in their area.
