 Stander told Lowvelder, “I saw a poster that belonged to an NGO asking people to assist a family in need. I told my students about what I saw and the hairdressing students suggested we start a food drive to assist them.” Stander is offering 10 hair colour sessions, worth R800 – R1000 each, in exchange for a food parcel.  She said, “Four clients have donated a list of groceries and will receive the service after the lockdown. There are six more left available to the public.” Stander and her students collected food and other necessities from Tawyn Ridge Complex and their friends and families. They also contributed to the cause.
