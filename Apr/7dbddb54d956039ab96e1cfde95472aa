 In the words of famous author Charles Dickens, ‘reflect upon your present blessings of which every man has many – not on your past misfortunes, of which all men have some’. These wise words have some merit in the unprecedented times we are currently experiencing.  Mostly, World Book Day would be celebrated by going to less-fortunate schools and places and providing them with new reading material. The day is designed to encourage youth to enjoy reading. This day is not only to celebrate books from all over the world but it also pays tribute to one of the greatest authors the world has ever known – William Shakespeare was born in April 1564 and died on 23 April 1616.  Books still remain a major source of information, entertainment and comfort during the lockdown, even when times and circumstances are uncertain. They have the ability to take your mind out of your home during this lockdown period. They can take you to Neverland with Peter Pan, and teach you to survive in the Jungle with Mowgli.  Books are created to keep you entertained and educate you at the same time. People have found comfort in books for a very long time. The first library opened its doors to the public in the 7th century and since then, libraries have done their part in giving people all over the world the opportunity to feel that comfort and safety when reading their books.
