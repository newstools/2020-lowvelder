 The charity organisation, which celebrates its birthday, decided to reach out to the community during the lockdown. The shelter homes many people, providing them food and providing in their needs during this period. Koos Schoonraad, chairperson of fundraising of the club, commented, “It is our 50th anniversary and we are committed to giving back to the community. After a Skype call with TJ Maré, we decided we would give them a sum of R10 000, as we do not know what their needs are. We also gave them 2 000 cups to serve the people at the shelter.” ALSO READ: Local celeb passes online course with flying colours He continued, “We are volunteering to help them pick up loaves of bread from the bakery. We bring it home, spread it with butter, and then deliver it to the shelter in the morning for breakfast. We have asked them to tell us their needs and we will assist where we can.” Maré commented, “The funds donated will be channeled into food, personal hygiene products, medicine and fuel.” He added, “We are keeping up and keeping on at the shelter. We are thankful for the donations we receive from the broader community.” ALSO READ: Mbombela twins pass away only five hours apart Schoonraad stated, “We  are opening this opportunity to the community. Whoever has serious needs can contact us at 082-335-1347 and we will help wherever we can.”
