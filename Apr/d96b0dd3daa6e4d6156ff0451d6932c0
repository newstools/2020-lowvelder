 Mbombela citizens can now help those in need at their nearest Pick n Pay till. Through its Feed the Nation campaign, the store is trying to do its part in assisting those left wanting during the Covid-19 coronavirus nationwide lockdown. Pick n Pay i’langa Mall kicked off its part in the campaign on Monday. This initiative was set in place to help children who are normally dependent on school feeding programmes, kids in orphanages, as well as vulnerable individuals at homeless shelters.

As another way of donating, shoppers can also “add extra rands” to their till slips. All they have to do is ask their cashier. A donation of only R21 can provide a person in need with one meal a day for a week. Customers can also convert their Smart Shopper points on the Pick n Pay app and donate them to FoodForward SA, or donate online through JAM SA and FoodForward SA.
