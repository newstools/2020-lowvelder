 The Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association’s (Lefpa) manager, André Scheepers, said, like many others, its staff members are also currently all working from home, but are on standby. The fire-detection camera service that the association gives its members, a 24/7 service detecting smoke and fire in high-risk areas in which it operates, is still functioning during this time.

Right now they are not particularly concerned about fires, because of the still-present greenery and the rain, but “as soon as it becomes dry and the first frost falls, it’s a different picture,” said Scheepers. As one of the largest fire-protection associations in the country, it deals with all aspects of detection, prevention, suppression, rehabilitation, and awareness and is a member of the Mpumalanga Umbrella Fire Protection Association.
