As a business in the forestry, pulp and paper industry which supplies chemicals, manufactures toilet paper and supplies packaging material for food products, cleaning and hygiene products and medical and hospital supplies – amongst a host of other essential services – Sappi plays a crucial role in keeping our country running effectively in a time like this. If the company fails to deliver the products and raw materials required by our supply chain customers, they, in turn, will not be able to produce and deliver the essential products that our nation needs at this difficult time. Sappi requires the woodfibre from our trees in order to manufacture the essential products required by consumers. For this to happen effectively, our R& D facilities, nurseries, planting, harvesting, firefighting, management services and transport to the mills need to continue.   Our mills produce renewable energy that release pressure from the national electricity grid.
