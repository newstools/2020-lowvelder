 “We call less critical patients weekly to determine their needs and will visit when indicated. This is to minimise their exposure to infectious diseases, such as Covid-19,” said Landi Bezuidenhout, Nelspruit Hospice CEO. They currently face challenges of not having enough plastic aprons, masks, alcohol-based hand sanitiser, liquid hand soap and wet wipes. They also have a shortage of personnel and face the risk of getting exposed to Covid-19. “A number of our fundraising actions have been postponed, resulting in a shortage of funds. Our patients have compromised immune systems and this puts them at greater risk of contracting Covid-19,” said Elmarie du Toit, fundraising manager of Hospice. Du Toit said although they are in lockdown, they are already looking for ways to compensate for the financial losses due to events being postponed.

We are looking for nearly-new designers or brands or interesting clothing and shoes (male and female), as well as interesting decor items that might be lying around at home. Now is the time where everyone has time to ‘autumn’ clean and we will gladly help you to repurpose these items for a worthy cause,” she said. Their offices are open during the lockdown period and people can help by donating money and medical supplies. Enquiries: 013-744-0095 or reception@nelspruithospice.co.za.
