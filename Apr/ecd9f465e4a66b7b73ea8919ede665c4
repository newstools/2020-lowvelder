Did you know that cottage cheese is incredibly easy to make at home, using only two ingredients? You will need:
• 2 litres full-cream milk
• 500 ml maas
• A muslin or cheese cloth Method:
Mix together the milk and maas and cover. Let it stand in a warm place and allow to curdle. Do not stir. This process can take up to 24 hours, so be patient. Line a colander with the clean cloth and suspend it over a bowl. Once your mixture has curdled, gently ladle the curds into the lined colander to strain the curds from the whey over the course of the next few hours. Stir the curds every once in a while to help it along. Scoop the cottage cheese into a clean bowl, cover and refrigerate. It is ready for use. You can add flavours of your own choice for savoury or sweet uses.
