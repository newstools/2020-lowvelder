 Earlier this week, the unmistakable yet unexpected roar of a JAS-39 Gripen filled the air over Mbombela. Reminiscent of the Kishugu Lowveld Air Show that would have taken place later this year, but had to be postponed, the roar saw aircraft enthusiasts burst from their houses to get a glimpse of it. Lowveld Air Show postponed to 2021 As a Gripen maintains speeds of up to 2 000 kilometres per hour, many missed it. Clive van Zyl, however, knew it was coming and so had his camera ready at Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport.  Lowvelder asked the South African Air Force (SAAF) to provide enthusiasts with more information about the flight. The SAAF confirmed that there were in fact two JAS-39 Gripens. • What was the purpose of the flight?
In short, it was a training flight. It was also an air patrol to stop any unauthorised flights. • Where did it come from?
Air Force Base Makhado in Louis Trichardt, Limpopo • At what speeds do the Gripen travel during such flight?
Between Mach 1 and Mach 2 (1000 and 2000 kilometres per hour) • How long did it take to reach Mbombela from Louis Trichardt during the training flight?
At mach 1, 15 minutes, and mach 2, eight minutes. That is around 300 kilometres. From Makhado to Pretoria (around 400 kilometres) would take around 20 minutes and at Mach 2, 10 minutes.
As the crow flies: Makhado to Pretoria – 15 minutes at Mach 1 and six minutes at Mach 2. From Mbombela to Pretoria – 10 minutes at Mach 1 and six minutes at Mach 2. • How long did the flight last for in total?
Around 45 minutes to an hour. • When can Lowvelders expect another flyover?
Who knows? To thank the people of Mbombela for being so obedient and cooperative, you might see us again soon.
