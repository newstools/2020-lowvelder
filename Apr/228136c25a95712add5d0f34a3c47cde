 The business will continue to operate its farming, processing, packing and distribution operations in order to help ensure food security in South Africa. “We fully support the decisive action taken by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the government to help mitigate the health, labour-market and economic impacts,” said Tracey Davies, CEO of Halls Fresh Produce. “We are committed to playing our role in supporting food security in South Africa, promoting best-practice health guidelines among employees and the community, and supporting our people in this incredibly tough economic environment.” Davies and her leadership team recognised the real, immediate risks of Covid-19 earlier in the year through the lessons learned via Halls’ business in China, and by the beginning of March were communicating health-care messages to all employees within Fresh Produce.
