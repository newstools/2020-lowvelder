Chris Jonck, Isuzu Motors South Africa executive: aftersales, subsidiaries and joint ventures, said Isuzu is committed to ensure that these vehicles remain on the road during the lockdown period. “Our aftersales team is on standby and customers can rest assure that their vehicles will get the necessary technical support to minimise the risk of downtime, thus ensuring ongoing supply of essential products and services.” In addition, IMSAf will provide a grace period of one month to Isuzu customers, supporting the servicing of vehicles, without affecting their warranties. Customers can also make use of corrosion inspection after lockdown up to Friday May 15, regardless of mileage and the age of the vehicle. “We are committed to ensure ongoing service and support to customers who are carrying out essential services during the lockdown period and we are taking into consideration the limitations of getting vehicles serviced during this time,” said Jonck.
