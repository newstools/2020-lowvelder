If you want to stream live, then you need data quantity for quality and speed to avoid those buffering breakups. 10Mbps is a good minimum speed, but the recommendation is 20Mbps and upwards. As for data, you ideally want 100GB or even uncapped. Data is a big package, but bite the bullet. Streaming is well worth it.  As a general rule, using several devices simultaneously needs more speed in order to keep them all running smoothly. Determine what you need from the suggestions already mentioned above, and then add a little more Mbps if you have extra people hogging the line. .   Here, your attention needs to be on Gigs. You want a high data package with any speed, as fibre is fast even on the lowest setting. As a guesstimate guide to working out how much data to get, movies average 1,5 to 4GB in size and songs are roughly 50MB. So, if you want to download just three movies, check some emails and hit social media, a capped package is perfect.  With an average twitch reflex of under 25 milliseconds, gamers need fast uploads.
