 An online portal was recently launched on which verified and trusted organisations can register their initiatives or projects and the public or businesses can choose which of the projects they wish to support. The initiative was created by internationally acclaimed advertising agency, Doyle Dana Bernbach (DDB), to assist South Africa in its fight against Covid-19. “How you can help” is designed to match volunteers and donors with those who need help the most. If you need help, the website navigates you to a platform where you can list a social initiative which will then be marketed through various project partners.  Caxton Local Media has pledged its support to the initiative and will regularly update readers on some of the great work being done.     CEO of DDB South Africa, Melissa Daniels, said: “We have curated a range of social causes that offer South Africans a chance to participate in this movement. This is Thuma Mina in action!” The #10MillionMasks project is currently being actively promoted as a priority as the daily statistics start to climb. Minister of Health, Zweli Mkhize, has asked all South Africans to wear masks whenever they are in contact with other people.  Homemade masks can significantly reduce the spread of infection, whether you are on a grocery run or caring for a sick relative. These masks can also be invaluable for people living in densely populated areas, those who generally don’t have access to masks and those who are unable to protect themselves.     Steve Biko Academic Hospital is one of the designated Covid-19 hospitals in Gauteng. The doctors and nurses dedicated to combating Covid-19 and supporting the many patients in Gauteng need your help. The personal protective gear shortage is putting the frontline staff who are fighting Covid-19 at risk. Here’s how you can help:  Any donation, big or small, will help.
