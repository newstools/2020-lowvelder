 The video begins where Nadal explains that he is in his house due to Covid-19 trying to stay healthy as the virus has hit his country quite hard as it has the rest of the world. He encourages the world to enjoy a good time with him during his video as this is not a time to be sad he says. He starts off by answering a very interesting question from a fan, “What keeps you motivated after the many victories you have had?” Photo credit: Stefan de Villiers To this, he answers very humbled that his motivation is very easy to understand and it is that he loves what he is doing and that he feels he is a very lucky person for the experiences that he is able to enjoy because of tennis. Further in the video, he spends quite a bit of time trying to add Federer to the video and even jokingly says it is his first Instagram live so the crowd must bear with him as it is not easy for him. Photo credit: Stefan de Villiers After Federer finally joins the video they joke and laugh about how long it took and they didn’t know whose fault it was as Federer kept logging in and out while Nadal tried to add him. Both star players say they have still done their exercises to be ready when they have to play again. Federer says he was hitting balls against the world. They continue talking about their childhood. They continue with just overall very light-hearted chats during the rest of the video making this video a must-watch positive video to cheer you up during these unprecedented times.

Nadal and Murray continue to chat light-heartedly and positively about the lockdown situation they are currently in.
