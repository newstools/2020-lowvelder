 “During the normal course of our work, we only look after children, but in the event of major disasters or events that affect large numbers of our population, our mandate then requires us to assist adults as well,” said Dr Andre Hattingh, executive director of PCA. “And we have been doing that since the first day of lockdown.” He added that preparation is the absolute key to success, as there are many very vulnerable people living in close proximity to one another in informal settlements and at care centres. Elderly and sick people are also stuck at home with no one to assist them with the food or medication they might need. “As an example, if one person in Soli-Deo-Gloria Care Centre Lydenburg tests positive for Covid-19, that whole community will not be allowed to leave the premises and will be quarantined. That might very well have a devastating effect on them, as the residents’ ages range from a few months to 80 years, ” Hattingh stated.

Affected camps and people under quarantine will need immediate help and support with food and care. “With the help of the public, we at PCA need to assist these people, while fully cooperating with government’s regulations and advice during the 21-day lockdown. The organisation supplies medical care and food to many individuals, care centres, as well as four informal settlements, totalling more than 1 500 people. And that is only the tip of a rather big iceberg.” Hattingh said many more individuals will require medical assistance and food as the pandemic progresses. “Hungry and scared people are very likely to leave their homes or the area of quarantine to find food and medication, potentially spreading the virus as they go. Thus we need to assist them and ensure they do not have to leave their homes. “We are also available to assist individuals or families confined to their homes. It will take the cooperation of the entire country to beat this, and we can only do that if we work together and do not think the rules only apply to certain people.

The earth is not flat and this virus is not to be ignored, so please cooperate and adhere to the rules. They are not there to annoy you, but to keep you safe and to keep us, your neighbours, safe as well. According to Hattingh, in order to assist the struggling communities the organisation will need large quantities of food and other items, as it could potentially be servicing and assisting a very large number of people throughout Mpumalanga. The immediate requirements are:
– Face masks
– Hand sanitiser
– Non-perishable food such as bully beef, rice and spaghetti
– Fruit and vegetables with a longer shelf life, such as apples and potatoes
– Funds for prescription medications from doctors
– Funds for doctors’ visits
– Diesel
– Tents for additional accommodation at care centres, if required
– Mattresses
– Bedding
– Thermometers
– Bottled water as people cannot go and fetch it. ALSO READ: Locking it down with the little ones “If you are able so spare any form or quantity of food or a required item, please donate it to us.
