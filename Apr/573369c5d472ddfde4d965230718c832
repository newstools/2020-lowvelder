 Already angered by the initial lockdown, some locals did not hide their dissatisfaction and are convinced that the extension will come with even tougher restrictions. “Life is tough as it is now, and it has only been two weeks. Just imagine two more weeks without any source of income and movement. And to be frank, I do not think this lockdown serves any purpose except frustrating us ordinary citizens,” said David Maluka, a street vendor from KaBokweni. He argued that even with the lockdown, people have been roaming the streets while others continue to sell and buy alcohol.

If government wants us to stay at home for some more time, I guess we will have to abide and do so. I am already using my last savings to buy more food, because I suspect government is going to impose stricter measures this time around,” he continued. Bongani Mathonsi, who is in full support of the extension, argued that South Africans, especially black people, do not take the virus seriously. “Many people still think this is a joke and that it will not affect them simply because they are black. I fully support government’s call to extend the lockdown so that people will start adhering to the safety measures that are there to help stop the spread of the virus,” he said.

Again, long queues became the order of the day.
