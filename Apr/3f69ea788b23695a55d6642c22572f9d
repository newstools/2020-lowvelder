 MBOMBELA – Cars need to be looked after during the lockdown. Leon van Zyl of Fast Track in Mbombela said people should tend to their battery during this period. “A drained battery can be avoided when the car is started regularly. Ride around the block or pull the car out the garage and then back in,” said Van Zyl. The Automobile Association of South Africa also has a few ways in which people can keep their cars in top condition. “Any vehicle that is left unused for a period of time may develop issues that require intervention to get running normally again. But the hassle of wanting to start a vehicle when the battery is drained, or driving on uneven wheels, may be alleviated with some proper home care for the next couple of weeks,” says the AA.

However, if you are going to be storing your vehicle for longer, additional steps may be needed,” warns the AA.

If you are leaving your vehicle unused for a long period, it will still require some maintenance. Do not assume that an unused vehicle is going to start first time weeks after it was last used if it is not properly cared for during the lockdown,” concludes the AA.
