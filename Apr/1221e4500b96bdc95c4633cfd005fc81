 The SANBS asks donors to continue donating to prevent a blood stock shortage, risking the lives of fellow South Africans. Relebohile Matsimbi told Lowvelder, “The lockdown should not discourage members of the public from donating lifesaving blood as we tackle this global health pandemic as a nation during this difficult period”. The SANBS is following the measures announced by the president to save lives and slow the spread of Covid-19. “We have taken precautionary measures to ensure that the people who utilise our facilities are protected. We are assessing donors at all entry points to our facilities and mobile sites. We have also equipped all sites with additional antiseptic sprays and alcohol-based wipes”. “Our trained healthcare practitioners operating in the field have been equipped with the necessary information to identify symptoms that may indicate Covid-19 infection. Should a donor not be feeling well, or exhibit any flu-like symptoms or signs of infection, they will not be permitted access to our facilities,” said Dr Jackie Thomson, SANBS medical director. Operating hours have been extended at donor centres to accommodate social distancing.
