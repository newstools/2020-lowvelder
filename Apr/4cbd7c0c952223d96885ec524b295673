 As the Covid-19 situation continues, many are uncertain of their circumstances and what will happen in the coming weeks and months. A little glimmer of hope and good news is that nature still remains a positive point for all South African citizens. Humans can learn a thing or two from nature as it goes through pollution, droughts, floods and many more but somehow still remains beautiful. On April 21, Kruger National Park received some much-needed rain. This made for quite the photo opportunity as Skukuza Golf Course was in a glorious state after the rain. The rainbow came out as if it just wanted to remind everyone that every bad situation has a positive side to it.

The river was full and one could see how grateful the mother and calf were for the much-welcomed rain.

A rare sight – but so beautiful Photo credit: Kruger National Park Twitter Let this be a lesson – no matter the situation, there is always a positive outcome if you look hard enough. President Cyril Ramaphosa reiterated this in his State of the Nation Address last night by saying that this situation will not last forever. In the words of Brian Tracy a Canadian-American motivational public speaker and self-development author you must develop an attitude of gratitude, and give thanks for everything that happens to you, knowing that every step forward is a step toward achieving something bigger and better than your current situation.
