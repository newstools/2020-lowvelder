 Contributions of cash and fresh produce are steadily coming in from many prominent Lowvelders, as well as food suppliers. A local operation for this organisation was formed 12 day ago. Covid Flight is an initiative set up by Felix Gosher, a commercial pilot from Gauteng. The members are mostly private helicopter and fixed wing pilots offering their services in various part of the country
Due to the size and weight of the consignments, privately owned vehicles are mostly used.  Last night an emergency consignment for a children’s aid organisation was packed and transported from a hanger used as storage at Nelspruit Airfield. Early this morning is was distributed in Masoyi.
This afternoon another bulky load of maize meal left for Acornhoek. It was voluntary loaded onto and transported by a vehicle offered by Mercy Air.
