 Crocodile Toastmasters Club has been hosting its meetings online since lockdown. 
“It has been a steep learning curve for all of us,” said Martin Tobias, newly re-elected president of the club. “Approximately 10 to 15 members participate in our virtual meetings through online meeting apps such as Zoom, Meet and Webex and it is excellent opportunity for speakers to hone their online presentation skills -something which is becoming more and more important in the new narrative we are experiencing currently,” Tobias continued. Crocodile Toastmasters Club meets every second and last Monday of the month. The next club meeting, which will be hosted on a virtual platform once again, is on July 13. Anyone interested in joining as a guest to see what it is all about, can contact any of the following persons: Mbali Dlamini on mbalzdlamz@gmail.com, or Sandra Jacobs on 082-853-7885. The newly elected Crocodile Toastmasters committee: Carlo da Cunha, Sandra Jacobs, Zaach Smith, Tina Baer, Errol Kersrt, Zani Barrish and Martin Tobias. Mbali Dlamini was not present.
