 Jean Rossouw, greenkeeper at Skukuza Golf Club, had two slightly out of the ordinary animal encounters on July 14. The first was a honey badger sighting early in the morning. Something he said does not happen regularly. He said they can sometimes be little troublemakers, but not on the course itself.  “You don’t really see them that often. I’ve only seen them a couple of times on the course in the last while.” Different to the badgers, hyenas keep Rossouw a bit busier when it comes to mischievous behaviour. One culprit recently made off with one of the holes’ flags while Rossouw was busy setting up the course for the day’s players. >Photo: Jean Rossouw, Skukuza Golf Club ALSO READ: Semblance of normality as Casterbridge Cinema reopens “I was on another part of the course and when I turned around, I saw it.” >Photo: Jean Rossouw, Skukuza Golf Club A supplier heading out after a delivery later sent a photo of the hyena, flag in mouth. Rossouw retrieved it and fixed the flag right up. >Photo: Jean Rossouw, Skukuza Golf Club Flags are taken off the course at the end of each day and set up again at the start, otherwise nature’s naughty dogs end up in situations like these more often.
