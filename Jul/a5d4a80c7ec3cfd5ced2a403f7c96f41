 MBOMBELA – The first Farmers Market @ Sonpark was held recently and gave locals the opportunity to show off their home-made and handmade products. Koos Schoonraad initiated the market to provide a platform for locals to generate an income during this difficult time.  He roped in Kobus Jacobs of Sonpark Centre and Pauline Moller to organise the event. The market will be held once a month at Sonpark, and the next event will take place on August 1. If you would like to get involved with the market or find out more, contact Elmarie Schoonraad at elmarie1704@gmail.com or phone 071-607-0598.
