 Being a voice to the voiceless was Nashua Lowveld’s aim as it donated blankets and 500 kilograms of dog food to SPCA Nelspruit last Thursday.  According to public relations officer, Lizca Kruger, Nashua Mpumalanga and Nashua Lowveld were wondering how to give back without having the chance of spreading the Covid-19 coronavirus.  “So we thought, you know, we want to be a voice for the voiceless like Nelson Mandela was.” The voiceless being the SPCA. “I mean these dogs can’t speak for themselves.” One of the adoptable dogs at SPCA Nelspruit, a female golden retriever that is about four years old. The same donation made in Mbombela was mirrored at the SPCA in Middelburg. Margaret Adams of SPCA Nelspruit said the food received could last them about two weeks. “I was tearing up a little bit because this is really amazing. It is going to help us so much. For the next two weeks they are going to be eating lavishly.” Something that really stuck with Kruger, as a dog mother of three herself, was how many pets have been surrendered during lockdown because people think animals might carry the virus.  “People are uninformed and it’s bad, you know.” ALSO READ: Blyde River Canyon Nature Reserve temporarily closed She said many of Nashua’s employees contribute to the SPCA and the company will continue to support the organisation. As soon as lockdown is over, she will personally present herself as a volunteer.
