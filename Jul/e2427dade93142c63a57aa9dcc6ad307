The statement continued, “This is sufficient to enable Eskom to suspend this period of load-shedding tonight from 22:00, with no load-shedding expected for the rest of the week.” The power utility further urged the public to reduce the use of heating appliances, geysers and other appliances as the system remains “unpredictable and unreliable”.
