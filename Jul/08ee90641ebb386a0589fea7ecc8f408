 The Ford Ecosport and recently released Figo Freestyle fit these segments like a glove and the demand is good for business. Research by Ford indicated that the four per cent growth in this segment in 2015 now stands at 10 per cent of total sales in 2020. “The mini SUV segment grew substantially with the maiden launch of the EcoSport in South Africa in 2013, and the model has dominated this class ever since,” says Atloli Lesela, brand manager for passenger cars at FMCSA. “The recent introduction of a six-speed automatic transmission for the EcoSport 1.5 Ambiente represents another trend-setting move for this successful model, which now also offers the best value for money automatic in the entry-level mini utility segment.” The demand for vehicles with automatic gearboxes have also tripled from 10,4 percent in 2017 to almost 31,3 percent in 2020. READ: Small in capacity but big at heart According to George Mienie, CEO of AutoTrader, SUVs are far more popular than sedans in South Africa.
“In June 2020, there were 35 per cent more searches for SUVs than for sedans. Searches for transmission type is overwhelmingly in favour of automatics*. “In June, 72 per cent of consumers who filtered by gearbox transmission when searching for the EcoSport wanted an automatic, whereas 26 per cent searched for manual; the remaining two per cent searched for a combination.” says Mienie. The longer suspension travel offered by both the Ecosport and the Figo Freestyle makes them the ideal travel companion on both tar and gravel roads. And, with excellent visibility courtesy of higher seating positions, exploring the countryside – in luxury – provides the perfect Covid-19 escape. When last did you visit your nearest Ford dealer?
