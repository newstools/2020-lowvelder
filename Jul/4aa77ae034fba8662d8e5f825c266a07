 You may drive within provincial boundaries, but must be home by 21:00, where you must then remain for the following seven hours. The only exceptions are for medical emergencies, security crises and for those who sleep out for permitted work purposes.  This is according to the third set of amendments to South Africa’s level three lockdown regulations that were gazetted on July 12. Click here for the regulations as gazetted on June 12, 2020. A new “Form 2” permit was introduced. Employers who need employees to travel across provincial boundaries, or between 21:00 and 4:00, can use the example below.  The issue of sleeping over is further regulated by regulation 39, which indicates that people may only sleep over at hotels, lodges, B&Bs, timeshare facilities, resorts and guest houses if they are there for work purposes, for isolation, or if they are tourists who have been stranded there since lockdown began.  Gyms, fêtes, bazaars, night clubs, accommodation establishments that have not been formally accredited and licensed, bars, taverns, shebeens and beaches remain off-limits. Parks may not be visited except for exercise, and then only when subjected to health protocols. Read: More on sporting events and training during lockdown.

If you make use of public transport, note that taxis and buses may be filled to 100 per cent capacity for travels shorter than 200 km. When the travel distance exceeds 200 kms, a 70 per cent capacity limit applies.
