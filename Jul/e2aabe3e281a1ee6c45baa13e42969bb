Since the screening and testing programme started in April, the province has screened 5 336 458 people. A total of 72 849 tests have so far been conducted. During her regular updates, the MEC responsible for this department, Sasekani Manzini, raised her concern over the massive increase of Covid-19 cases in the province. “Of major concern is that the province has been recording an average increase of 181 for epidemiologic week 17. They increased by 179 in the past 24 hours. Our data shows that males account for 53 per cent of the overall cases in Mpumalanga,and the age group of 30 to 39 represents the majority of cases at 34 per cent, followed by the 21 per cent in the 40 to 49 age group. “This shows that the majority of active Covid-19 cases come from the economically active working category,” said Manzini. Following these ever-increasing numbers, she has once again stressed the need for everyone to be vigilant and more careful than ever before. “I want to appeal to everyone, especially young people to be active ambassadors in the fight against Covid-19 by advocating for behavioural change and resisting the temptation of gathering in large groups,” appealed Manzini. With social distancing and gatherings in large numbers, especially in townships still being a problem, Manzini made a plea for communities to start taking this virus seriously. “This virus is real and deadly. It has the potential of destroying all of us. Remember, it’s now winter and we are at the peak of
this virus. “For us to win the battle we need to tread carefully and start living responsibly. “We can start by avoiding our usual hangout spots and stay at home. If we are to travel and commute to work or to do shopping, just remember to wear cloth masks and always sanitise,” said Manzini. To date 44 people have died in the province and these numbers, according to Manzini, could keep going up if communities don’t change their behaviour.
