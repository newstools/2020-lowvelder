 Earlier today, the larger community of Graskop handed over a memorandum to the mayor of Thaba Chweu Local Municipality, Frieda Nkadimeng. This was done in a bid to have amendments made to the current electricity tariffs. Listed on the memorandum were requests by residents for the immediate cancellation of the fixed levy of R185, the immediate refund of all levies charged and paid to the municipality since July 1, and the implementation of a direct supply from Eskom and payments to be made directly to the power utility.  Residents also called for the scrapping of tenders being awarded to out-of-ward contractors, transparency with regards to the awarding of tenders, with the Graskop community and local businesses being informed beforehand and having first preference, given that all requirements and criteria have been met, and lastly, improved service delivery.
