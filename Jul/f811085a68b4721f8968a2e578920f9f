 MBOMBELA – A male hippopotamus was killed in a four car crash between Mbombela and Malalane at about 06:30 this morning. According to the N4 TRAC communications manager, Solange Soares, the crash occurred between the Valencia Link and Crocodile Valley directional interchange. Two light motor vehicles were involved in the crash and a stop-and-go put in place to regulate the early morning traffic as officials worked to clear the scene. Soares said that the hippopotamus  was crossing the eastbound towards westbound and is believed to have come out of the river.
