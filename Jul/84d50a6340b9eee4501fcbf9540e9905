 Lowvelder Express  has reliably learned that it all began when one of the staff members working in the theatre tested positive on Saturday after displaying symptoms of
the virus. Her colleagues were screened and tested and their results came back positive as well.
“Our concern is how many other staff members and patients were the affected members in contact with? We do not agree with the hospital’s decision to partly close the theatre ward alone. All nurses and doctors need to be tested and the hospital closed,” said a nurse who spoke on condition of anonymity.
