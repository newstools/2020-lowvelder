 As unemployment increases, so do people’s inability to look after their pets. Animal shelters as well as the SPCA are experiencing in influx of what they refer to as “surrenders” – animals surrendered to their care. Winter is also upon us and this contributes to the need. Shelters can turn people away – the SPCA cannot. Pro-Life Pet Rescue’s owner, Karin Erasmus, indicated that because they were able to find new homes for most of the animals that were in foster care, they have been able to accommodate some surrenders. “If people are struggling to feed their pets, they are most welcome to contact us for advice and help. They could also request help via social media because there really are caring people out there who will help.” READ: Pro-Life are back to “normal” As a result of the pandemic, neither Pro Life or the SPCA can do fundraising. “It is frustrating.”
For the SPCA, the challenge is more severe – it cannot turn surrenders away. It is bound by the law to provide help and it can only do this if the community opens its heart – like it has done so many times before. Residents are urged to donate food, blankets, money or go onto the SPCA’s auction on its Facebook page.

The SPCA needs repairs on one of its vehicles as soon as possible.

With your help, it can be prevented.” Lets help one another, in order to help ourselves. “Thank you for all your contributions and consistent support,” from both SPCA and Pro Life.
