 To accommodate this never-ending enthusiasm for seat time, Kenny Howard recently built a flat track at the entrance to Elawini, next to the golf driving range. “It is important to take note that this is not a race track. Its purpose is to offer a training facility and leisure riding for six days of the week. The surface is purposefully soft and loose to prevent serious injury when riders – especially the junior and inexperienced ones, lose control and drop their bikes,” said Howard. The track, a work in progress, is about 1,5km long and offers about seven good obstacles and short straights. Best of all, the facility offers a resident and experienced riding trainer in William Sutherland.

He now uses four tracks – Elawini, Hazyview, Kiepersol and Brondal, from where he will offer riders – beginners to pros – training on specific days of the week.  “I currently have about 15 students training at Elawini. The intention is to develop the riding skills of these youngsters to enable them to compete on provincial and national level,” said Sutherland. “I teach technical skills as well as techniques to execute technical movements at speed. The latter seems to be a challenge for many youngsters.” Shari Oberholzer, who brought her two boys to the track for the first time and on the day I visited, said having a facility like this available during the week is perfect because most tracks become crowded over weekends, which makes it difficult or near impossible for the youngsters to learn and practice. “We love this,” echoed the boys.
