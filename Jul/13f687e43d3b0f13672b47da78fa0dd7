 According to information received, on December 24, 2019, Thokozile was seen with her friends at one of the liquor outlets in Siyabuswa. Her friends reportedly said she was with a man believed to be from Kwaggafontein. She has apparently not returned since and an enquiry into her disappearance was registered. “During the investigation, it has since come to light that Thokozile contacted her mother several times using different cell phone numbers where she indicated that she was in the area of Kwaggafontein. She did, however, not disclose the exact location. She promised her mother that she would go back home, but has still not returned,” Hlathi said. Anyone with information that might help police locate her, is urged to contact Det Sgt George Msiza at 076- 776- 0956 or the SAPS Crime Stop number on 086-001-0111.
