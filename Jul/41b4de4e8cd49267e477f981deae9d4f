 According to Jchaan de Beer, operational manager of Hi-Tech White River and Hazyview, the incident occurred around 18:00. “From what can be gathered from the scene, it seems as if the victim attempted to run across the road before being hit by the bus. The incident occurred on the corner of Tom Lawrence and Hennie van Til streets,” he said. “Skid marks of around 50 metres could be a clear indication that the driver of the bus tried to avoid the collision, but to no avail,” he added.
