 He allegedly raped a 14-year-old near a sports ground last Saturday. His bail application was partly heard and postponed to tomorrow due to shortages of water at the court. Speaking through his legal representative, Adv Rodney Segage, the pastor said he intends to plead not guilty to the charge levelled against him. Segage said the court should consider releasing his client on bail because he was not a flight risk and has a permanent address in the area. “He also cooperated well with the police during his arrest,” he said.
