 There are plenty of locally owned restaurants in the Lowveld, many of them well-known to the public. Monique Sebold, owner of Que’s Café in Sonpark Centre, said to the media on Tuesday during the protest that she is taking a stand with the other restaurant owners in the centre against the regulations. “We need help and the government is looking past us. The sit-down regulations and the alcohol ban has created huge financial issues for the most of us,” Sebold said.

If they are afraid to be out in public, they can still order from us and we will deliver to the safety of their home.” Claud Kruger, Urban House owner, also commented on the regulations. He had the following to say, “The loss has been exponential. We were only open for around five months before lockdown. The goal of the protest is to create awareness for the public to get rid of their fear of going to a restaurant. I consider Sonpark as the heart of Mbombela with its boulevard vibe”.
