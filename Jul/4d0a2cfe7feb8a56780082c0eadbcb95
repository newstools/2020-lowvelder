 Mbombela motorists recently hit a surprise along Enos Mabuza Drive if they werenâ€™t paying attention to roadsigns. Three speedbumps have been added to the street with the first just after the Johanna and Enos Mabuza drive intersection (heading in the direction of Madiba Drive).  The last of the three appears a few metres before the Mediclinic turn-off.

This is a developing story. More details will be provided when received.
