 Since its debut in 2006, the Mazda BT-50 has been sold mainly in Oceania, ASEAN, Central and South America, the Middle East and Africa. Based on Isuzu’s D-MAX bakkie, special care went into the vehicle’s design, ease of use and creating peace of mind for the occupants. The all-new Mazda BT-50 fuses Mazda’s Kodo-Soul of Motion design language and premium interiors with power, toughness and utilitarian functionality suited to a bakkie.  Mazda’s Kodo – Soul of motion design language is immediately visible in the front grille, which makes it an undeniable part of the Mazda family. The Kodo design language is evident right from the front of the vehicle with the prominent front grille, and the three-dimensional signature wing that extends out towards the side.  The design of the headlights is distinct and sharp, taking in cues from Mazda’s SUV range. The low-sitting headlights and a wide design give the front a more muscular look that translates to a strong and powerful road presence. The chrome parts from the front grille extend right through to the mirror and door handles, forming a distinctive unbroken centre line that flows from the front to the rear of the vehicle.
The BT-50s interior cabin space has been carefully crafted to express Mazda’s commitment to human-centric design. Everything from dashboard, steering wheel, seats and centre console has been redesigned to ensure that drivers feel connected to their vehicle and as comfortable as they can be. There is a sense of power and Mazda premium inside the cabin, with a stronger steering wheel and dashboard, and seats that wrap around the body especially when driving off-road. Mazda developed the Mazda BT-50 with the intention of making travel and the time spent inside the vehicle exceptionally pleasant. The vehicle’s driving performance, functionality and safety meet the active needs of the wide range of situations in which customers may use bakkies. QuickPic.
