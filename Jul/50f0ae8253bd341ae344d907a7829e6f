 MBOMBELA – “Lockdown has affected us all in many ways and the market is our way of encouraging our local community to become more self-sufficient, find alternate forms of income and to have access to wholesome produce,” said Jennifer Schormann, organiser of the event. “We run our property on permaculture principles – so all fresh produce selected to be included in the market is either organic or grown regeneratively.” The weekly Saturday market at The Bardolino Artists Retreat on the Hermansburg Road is of a drive-through nature, giving shoppers an opportunity to buy wholesome produce in a tranquil setting, avoiding busy shopping centres.
