 The missing police officer, Const Baswabile Mildred Silowe (26), who had been reported missing by her sister at the Bushbuckridge Police Station on Sunday, has since been found.
Silowe left her home on Sunday afternoon to travel back to work in Lydenburg using public transport. When she arrived at a shopping complex to take a second taxi to Lydenburg, she was offered a lift by an unknown man and instantly informed her sister.
Her sister called to check up on her several times, but failed to reach her. She also called Siloweâ€™s roommate who confirmed that she had not arrived. The sister then became anxious and reported the matter to the SAPS which immediately launched a search.
