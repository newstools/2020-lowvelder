 This landmark anniversary also coincides with the original dates of this year’s postponed 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race – a competition PEUGEOT has won on three occasions. In 2022, PEUGEOT will return to endurance racing and look to write the next chapter of its motorsport story. Since the Type 7 triumphed in 1895, Peugeot has tasted success across the globe, competing with distinction everywhere from frozen world rally stages in Scandinavia, the towering dunes of the Dakar and even the high altitude challenge of the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. Jules Goux – 1913 Indianapolis winner. Peugeot motorsport timeline 1895: A Type 7 PEUGEOT wins the 1895 Paris-Bordeaux-Paris race on 13 June, which is considered to be the first-ever car race in history. Arriving initially in third place, the 1.3-litre, Type 7, driven by Paul Koechlin (FRA), was declared winner after the first two vehicles were found to be in breach of the competition rules. Koechlin completed the 1,178km (731-mile) race in 59 hours and 48 minutes. 1912-19: Peugeot became a three-time Indy 500 winner between 1913 and 1919. French racing driver Jules Goux won the Indy 500 in 1913, becoming the first person outside the United States to win the race – clocking an average speed of 122km/h at the 200-lap race. PEUGEOT also won the race in 1916 and 1919. In 1912 and 1913, PEUGEOT won the Grand Prix de l’Automobile Club de France.  The 1960s: The Peugeot 404 became a quadruple winner of the East African Safari Rally, taking the wins in 1963, 1966, 1967 and 1968. Due to the difficult conditions in both 1963 and 1968, only seven vehicles made it to the finish – representing just eight per cent of the field – earning them all the nickname of the “Unsinkable Seven”. The 1970s: Peugeot secured its status as a rally icon in the 1970s. In 1975, the 504 won the Safari Rally, Rallye du Maroc and the Bandama Rally. The following year, the 504 won the Rallye du Maroc and Bandama Rally once more. In 1978, piloting a 504 Coupé V6, Jean-Pierre Nicolas (FRA) won the Safari Rally for a third time in the decade for Peugeot, with the brand also clinching the Ivory Coast Rally.  The 1980s: The 1980s were the heydays of rallying thanks to the iconic Group B era. During this period, Peugeot tasted success thanks to a number of Finnish rally aces and one brilliant car. The Peugeot 205 T16 became a legend in the hands of Timo Salonen and Juha Kankkunen, winning the drivers and manufacturers championship in 1985 and 1986. The turbo-charged 205 T16 was one of the most successful cars of the Group B era. Peugeot also conquered the punishing Paris-Dakar Rally four times between 1987 and 1990 with the 205 T16 and the 405 T16 in the hands of Finnish drivers Ari Vatanen and Juha Kankkunen.
