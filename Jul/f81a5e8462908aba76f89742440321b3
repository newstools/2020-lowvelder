 MBOMBELA – Although it would have made for an interesting story, the photo of a man allegedly unaware of lions in the background, turned out to have a different backstory. For the past couple of weeks, the photo started showing up all over social media platform, accompanied by text claiming that the lions were only noticed when the camera’s flash went off.    Lowvelder was able to track down the actual photographer, Willem Botha, who provided the circumstances surrounding the photograph. Botha, former assistant warden head of anti-poaching, game capture and problem animal control at Sabi Sand Game Reserve from 2002 to 2010, confirmed that the picture was indeed taken at Khutse Game Reserve in Botswana as the post claims. “The photo has done its rounds on Facebook and other social media with many different people claiming to be the photographer and with many different stories behind the photo. It got more than enough criticism, both positive and negative,” he said. “I took this picture about eight years ago. My friend, Stefan van der Walt, and I went to sleep on the roofs of our vehicles. Around midnight I woke up when I felt my vehicle rocking from side to side. I went back to sleep and it starting moving again. When I went to investigate with my headlamp, I saw a lion chewing on my Mitsubishi Pajero’s spare wheel,” he said.   Van der Walt and Botha were part of a group of eight men which regularly visits Khutse Game Reserve.  “We later discovered as much as eight lions in the camp,” Botha said, and added that they were fully aware of the lions when the photo was taken. “I have more than 20 years of bush experience, and am very familiar with the behaviour of wild animals – especially lions. After carefully assessing the situation, and the lions’ behaviour, I decided that it is safe to take these pictures,” he said.
