 A year ago the structures were demolished by the City of Mbombela Local Municipality (CMLM). Lowvelder has been reporting on this issue since 2018 when the squatters were ordered by the court to stop construction on the municipality’s land. CMLM approached the court after people had started allocating land among themselves and proclaimed the section of Tekwane West as Nomzamo Park, demanding municipal services such as water and electricity.  The municipality obtained a court order to stop construction, but it did not, and CMLM approached the court again. The municipality was then granted an order to demolish. The demolition sparked outrage in April 2019 among residents, who demanded to be relocated as they had nowhere else to go. They took to the road with burning tyres and branches in protest.

Lowvelder approached the spokesperson for CMLM, but after more than a month, and acknowledging receipt of the enquiry, Joseph Ngala has yet to respond.
