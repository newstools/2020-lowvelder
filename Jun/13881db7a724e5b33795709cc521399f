 The Mpumalanga provincial government is currently running more than 80 sanitation projects as part of its efforts to ensure that all schools, particularly those in rural areas, have adequate ablution facilities. These projects have been running since January, but have been delayed due to the Covid-19 coronavirus and subsequent national lockdown. The MEC for public works, roads and transport (DPWRT), Gillion Mashego, has been visiting several schools across the province where the department has been busy with these projects.

Mxolisi Cyril Dlamini, acting spokesperson for the department, relayed that the MEC was impressed with the progress made so far since most of the work had been completed.  The facilities at Glory Hill Primary and other schools in the province were contracted by the DPWRT after the Department of Education had identified those in need.   Certain other schools that Mashego will visit today as well as on Thursday and Saturday, include the following:  ALSO READ: Covid-19 school orientation workshop halted in Mbombela Of the more than 80 active projects, Dlamini said most are at least 90 per cent done.
