 With unprecedented times hitting companies hard globally, you may have considered cutting the marketing budget. This step is every marketer’s nightmare and contrary to what we have learnt from previous situations such as the one we face at the moment. The situation currently experienced by companies calls for them to take opportunities and gain market share, as well as grow their consumer base. Research has found that consumers and the general public expect companies to advertise in this period and are less likely to place their trust in them if they don’t. Remaining at the forefront of consumers’ minds is a top priority for businesses. It is important that when consumers find themselves in need of a product or service your business is the first they will think of, and advertising gives you just that. As Mark Ritson, brand consultant and former marketing professor, puts it, “during a recession marketers have two weapons – brand and ads”.  Brands can find themselves in an unusual situation where they can build a competitive advantage against other brands, especially by planning smartly for the recovery, and advertising when not many other brands are.
