 Many remember this from their childhood and do not want it differently, while others want this as an option to experience the past. Balule is named after the Tsonga word for the Olifants River, and this camp is one of the best places for guests to experience nature first-hand. Situated more or less
in the centre of the KNP, just south of Olifants Camp, Balule lies close to  the river. With only the most basic of facilities and no electricity, a low fence is the only barrier that separates you from the wilderness, resulting in a true back-to-basics experience. It is this unique wilderness feel of the camp that makes it a firm favourite with backpackers, the caravanning community and other visitors who want to get away from into all.  Balule Camp is divided in two sections, separated by a fence at Balule’s KNP accommodation. One section has six three-bed budget huts and communal bathroom and kitchen facilities. Paraffin lamps provide lighting for your Kruger budget accommodation. Each hut is provided with linen and towels.

There are no cooking utensils, crockery or cutlery available in the huts, but the camp has a communal kitchen with a scullery and gas stove. Limited space is available in the communal freezer.

A large grove of Natal mahogany, baobab and sausage trees provides a welcome shade from the sun while you are resting. Facilities such as a shop, restaurant and fuel station are available at Olifants Camp, 11 kilometres north.  The campsite is also quite small, but because of this and Balule’s popularity, you need to book well in advance to secure your space, especially over long weekends and holiday periods.
