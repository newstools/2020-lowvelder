The lockdowns imposed by both countries in an effort to curb the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus meant that the movement of people was limited. Monyela confirmed that there are over 150 South African citizens currently stranded in the country and that they will be able to travel home in the given time frame, however, border hours still apply.
