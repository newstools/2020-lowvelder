Eyewitnesses (his colleagues) said the victim himself shouted and warned them to move away from runaway. “As the aircraft made the landing, the man apparently thought he was allowing enough space for the aircraft to do so. He was, however, hit by the wing of the plane and killed on impact,” said Hlathi. He added that the men were originally from Soweto, Gauteng.  Even though the Lowveld and Escarpment Fire Protection Association (Lefpa) uses the airfield during the fire season, its manager André Scheepers, confirmed that no firefighting personnel or Lefpa aircraft were involved. Speaking on behalf of the Accident and Incident Investigation Division (AIID) at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Kabelo Ledwaba, confirmed that the accident did take place, adding that it was reported soon after occurring.
