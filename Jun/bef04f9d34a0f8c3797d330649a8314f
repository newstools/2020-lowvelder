 MBOMBELA – The primary intention of the Covid-19 coronavirus restrictions was to curb the spread thereof. And they did. It also, as an added benefit, deterred crime and domestic violence, among others. This was short-lived though as the incidents of gender-based violence (GBV) and farm attacks have dramatically increased since the country moved to level 3. READ: South Africa’s shocking gender based violence statistics The South African Policing Union (Sapu) has also come out in support of addressing GBV.
The union refers to “the root causes – social inequalities” that lead to partners or people known to the victims, committing these crimes. In a statement released this week, the general secretary of Sapu, Tumelo Mogodiseng, called for communities to apply the basics of ubuntu/botho. The African way is to know and care for one another as if everyone is your own. People often use the expression, “I am because you are”, which is about an acknowledgement of and sharing of collective responsibility towards every person. ALSO READ: Plans to fight gender-based violence Sapu also called for the return of community sector policing as this has in the past proved effective, as it improves and builds better relationships between the police and the community. It acknowledged the “forgotten community” of lesbian, gay, and bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) community and called for “specialised systems” to deal with crimes within these circles. It urged government to apply the same vigour and attention in combating GBV as it does with Covid-19.
The SAPS should be equipped to address these cases with the sensitivity and urgency they dictate. Communities and families should not turn a blind eye to domestic violence. If you don’t nip it in the bud, it escalates and everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. Ubuntu is a collective responsibility – I am because you are and if I don’t speak out, I am responsible.
