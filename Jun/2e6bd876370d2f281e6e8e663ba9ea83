According to those on the scene, it was speculated that the Toyota had rolled, because its engine was completely dislodged and lying apart from the rest of the car. Part of the axle, with two of the wheels, was also lying to one side. “There are 14 law-enforcement operations across the province on all the major roads. I would like to remind everyone to abide by the rules and regulations of the road. Those who do not adhere to the rules will be harshly dealt with,” Mmusi concluded.
