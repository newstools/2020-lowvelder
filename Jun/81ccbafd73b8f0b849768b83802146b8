 MBOMBELA -Hi-Tech Security in a recent statement urged Lowvelders to take extra care when it comes to electronics as they have become a target for criminals in the region. “The theft of laptops, tablets, cellphones and other personal electronics is increasing drastically,” said Callum Mac Pherson, operational manager of Hi-Tech Security, adding that a vehicle gets broken into at least twice a day, within the boundaries of Mbombela. “Along with the spike in electronics theft, house break-ins occur more than twice a day within the same area, and these are only the cases Hi-Tech knows of,” he said. Furthermore, thieves target gate motors, mountain bikes and outdoor spotlights,” he said, adding that the current economic climate could be a contributing factor to the sharp increase. How can you reduce the risk of having your electronic devices stolen, according to Hi-Tech? · Don’t leave your devices in your vehicle, even if the vehicle is in your driveway or garage, and never leave it in plain sight, even if the vehicle is locked — that’s just inviting trouble. If you must leave your devices in a vehicle, the best place is in the boot. If you don’t have a boot, try to conceal them or fit them under a seat and lock the doors.
· Carry your devices in a nondescript carrying case, briefcase, or bag when moving about. Placing these items in a case designed for computers is an immediate alert to thieves that you have these valuable devices.
· Lock your device in a safe place when not in use.
· When using your laptop at home, make sure you do not leave it close to a window. Thieves will go to great lengths to get your laptop with force or break windows open.
· Apply distinctive paint markings to make your laptop unique and easily identifiable.
