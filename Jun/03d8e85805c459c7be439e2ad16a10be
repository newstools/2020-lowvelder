The accident happened at 06:38. The drivers of the vehicles were travelling westbound (Pretoria direction) when the truck hit the bus from behind. “The westbound slow lane remains closed and a stop-and-go is in place on the eastbound lanes. Traffic is flowing smoothly for now,” said TRAC communications manager, Solange Soares. She said there is also a diesel spillage as a result of the accident that is currently being cleaned up. There was only one serious injury and LowMed EMS transported the patient to Mbombela.  ALSO READ: A small decline in road deaths dictates improved education
