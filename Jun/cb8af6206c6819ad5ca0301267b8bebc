 The MEC for the Department of Ccooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta), Mandla Msibi, has opened a case against scammers. This happened after his name was used to scam people of their money. The scammers created a fake email account in his name to obtain money from oblivious victims. In the email the scammers said,”Hi. I need your urgent assistance, as I am having issues with my bank account making withdrawals and transfers and I need to send an urgent EFT/eWallet transfer to my cousin whom I need to pay. Please can you help me send the eWallet/EFT to my cousin’s account? I will sort you out once my bank account is fixed. PS I am in a meeting now and can’t talk. Just reply back.” Msibi said he opened a case at the Nelspruit Police Station to stop the unlawful use of his name. “I will not allow criminals to use my name for their nefarious games. Opening the case is the first step before considering other remedies of dealing with this matter. Otherwise I run the risk of having a tarnished image ,” he elaborated.
