The other uninjured officials immediately attended to him, giving the suspects a chance to flee the scene on foot. Shabalala denounced the killing of Mdluli adding that those who attack law enforcement are directly attacking the state which must be harshly dealt with. “Any cowards who attack the law enforcement officers are attacking the state and therefore communities should work with the police and assist towards arresting those devil doers,”she said. The MEC for community safety in Mpumalanga, Gabisile Tshabalala, called on law enforcement to continue working hard in defending the communities and not to be deterred by criminals who attack them.
