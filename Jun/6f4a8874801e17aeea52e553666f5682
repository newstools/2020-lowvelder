 Women at the Greater Rape Intervention Project (GRIP) shelter have been hard at work manufacturing face masks. Children at the shelter have learnt how to crotchet and have been making the strings for the masks that the women sew. They are now selling these masks in order to aid the live-in residents. “Some people are allergic to the elastic and we found that the crocheted wool ones are softer and more comfortable,”said Barbara Kenyon, founder of GRIP. “Some of the children mastered the skill in a matter of minutes. It was incredible.” The women and children enjoy the project. “We like keeping busy and being able to learn new skills. It also helps us because we can use the money  for the shelter or to send our children to school.
