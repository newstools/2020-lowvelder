 WHITE RIVER – “My heart cries when I see or hear of children who experience hardship whether this be hunger, emotional trauma or otherwise. My heart cries when I express gratitude for what I have compared to so many others. My heart cries when I see how proud parents are forced to hide their pride and request support to enable them to care for their family,” said Liezel Lüneburg. She drives the social assistance programme at Hoërskool Rob Ferreira. “A hungry learner just does not have the capacity to pay attention in class. We have an obligation to assist and address these issues to the best of our ability, during and outside of school terms and thus the motivation for our CMR initiatives,” said Rob’s principal, Dawie Oberholtzer.  “We are truly grateful for the many donations – money and food – that we receive from companies and individuals who enable us to do what we do. We have 15 volunteer moms who take turns to prepare lunchboxes every week and then we also donate vegetables and grocery parcels to families in need.

As part of our outreach, we have appointed a counsellor to assist both learners and parents with tools to manage the many challenges of the current situation.”  It is a given that the demand for support will keep growing, thus Lüneburg and her team hope to have the capacity to reach out to other schools in the near future. South Africans have always been able to share empathy and reach out where there is a need. It helps to heal one’s own pain and displays our strong commitment to the philosophy of ubuntu.
