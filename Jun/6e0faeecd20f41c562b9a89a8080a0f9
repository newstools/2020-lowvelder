 MBOMBELA – CANSA Lowveld Care Centre has been given the incredible opportunity by Kobus Jacobs, owner of Sonpark Centre, to open the store. Second-Time-Around, situated next to Que’s Cafe in Sonpark Centre, features pre-loved clothes for all ages and sizes. Pauline Möller, fund development coordinator at CANSA Lowveld, said, “We received pre-loved items that look like new, making it possible for us to offer the best quality, second-hand items.” Loyal and committed CANSA volunteer, Koos Schoonraad, assisted in creating an inviting look and feel with beautiful display rails and shelves in the store. He also has a vision for the store to stock home-baked goods.
