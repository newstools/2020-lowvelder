 Mario Paul, tour guide and photographer at Wild Photo Africa, said it was a great experience and a wonderful day. They arrived at 05:00 at the Malelane Gate, where there were already 10 cars ahead of them. “Apparently, the first guy was already there by about 23:00 the previous day,” Paul said. He added that the process went smoothly and without hiccups. “It was a bit slow, but that’s understandable. There is a lot more paperwork that needs to be done and temperatures have to be taken. “Our primary mission was to go out and do some birding. We encountered about 111 bird species on the day and also some good mammal sightings.” Paul had a few chats with fellow nature lovers and mentioned that one woman said she hadn’t seen much, but just to be out and about and experience nature again was good enough for her.
