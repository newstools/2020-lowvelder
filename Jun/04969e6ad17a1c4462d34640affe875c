 Legacy Hotels & Resorts has partnered with Nutriwell to feed communities neighbouring its hotels and resorts during the Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic. To date, Nutriwell has helped feed more than 1 million children with its range of fortified powdered products, including a thick vegetable soup, soya stew mince, instant porridge and an instant beverage shake. Now Legacy Hotels & Resorts, through its Legacy Pride NPC, is contributing 7 500 individual nutritionally balanced meals per day. It has set a target of achieving 15 000 meals per day for the next three months. SizaBantswana Orphans in Hazyview received 15 000 meals, and households in Belfast in Mpumalanga received 48 000 meals. The project also assisted communities in other provinces, donating 16 000 meals to Friends for Life in Alexandra,  48 000 to each of the North West’s Mogwase and Ledig communities and  27 000 meals to the Baphemele Children’s Home in Cape Town.  “Legacy has more than 20 properties across the continent, and involvement and upliftment are a big part of our ethos,” said Robert Hodson, group marketing manager of Legacy Hotels & Resorts. “The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic has further highlighted the significant inequalities that exist in our country, and now more than ever, we need to help one another in the fight against poverty.” “By partnering with an organisation like Nutriwell, we can continue our work with local community upliftment, while also investing in the health and well-being of our greatest resource – our children,” he concluded.
