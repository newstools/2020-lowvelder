“We all thoroughly deserve the time to relax with our friends and families. If we remember a few basic security measures, we can make a big difference towards enjoying this time of year in safety,” said Charnel Hattingh, head of marketing and communications for Fidelity ADT. The first and most important step to take, she said, is to regularly test your alarm to ensure that it is in good working order. It is also a good idea to let your security company know what your holiday plans are and how best to get in touch with you in the event of an emergency. Additional security tips for holidaymakers to make sure their residential property is protected and safe:• Cut back any bush or trees that may offer easy access over walls or gates to your property, or provide places for criminals to hide.• Inform your neighbours and neighbourhood watch of your holiday plans so that they can keep an eye on your property.• If hiring a house-sitter, ensure that you teach them how to use your alarm correctly.• If you don’t have a house-sitter, ask a neighbour or a friend to turn on lights occasionally so that there is a sense that someone is around. If this is not possible, consider putting your outside ones on a timer.• Double-check that you have locked and secured all windows and doors before leaving home.• Turn off your geyser and any unnecessary electrical appliances so you can save on electricity and be environmentally-friendly. “We also recommend that people be careful and discreet about packing for a long journey and to not give any indication that your home might be unattended for an extended period of time,” said Hattingh. The key thing to remember is to make sure that everyone in your family is prepared and that they know exactly what to do in a case of an emergency. “It doesn’t matter if you are relaxing at home or next to the ocean these holidays. If something were to happen to you or a loved one, make sure you know who to contact for emergency assistance,” she concluded.
