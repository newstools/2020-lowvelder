Minister of Police Bheki Cele said Mpumalanga crime statistics do not tell a good story. He was addressing law enforcers and the media at Nelspruit Rugby Stadium on Tuesday. This is part of his nationwide Safer Festive Season Operations inspection tour under the theme #OperationTightGrip.  “Your murder statistics are not telling a good story. I am not going to give out figures, but it is not a good story. Theft, house robberies, burglaries, the abuse of women, grievous bodily harm (GBH), rape and social offences are increasing.”   He urged the public to be responsible during the festive season. He also urged all law enforcement agencies to ensure that they protect their lives from both crime and the Covid-19 pandemic.
