Much to the relief of many it turned out that no one was hurt and the bakkie was removed from the river early on Saturday morning, December 26. KNP spokesperson, Ike Phaahla, said a man had been driving alone in the Kruger on Christmas Day when he lost control of his vehicle while crossing a low-level bridge over the Crocodile River. “The lone occupant lost control and was rescued from the river unharmed,” said Phaahla.  The Latest Sightings-Kruger Facebook Page posted the photos of the bakkie on its side, quickly garnering hundreds of comments, wondering what had happened and if the driver and other possible occupants were okay. However, a few park visitors who passed the scene shortly after the accident commented on the post and provided everyone with an update.

Apparently it was people from a sunset drive and he told us nobody was hurt or eaten. Driver apparently just lost control.” Another Facebook user, Chevonne Vermaak Anderson, commented that she saw the whole accident. “Guys we saw the whole thing happen. It was just an unfortunate accident. It was very dark and it was just an accident, not speeding or reckless driving,” said the comment.  “I am sure you have had unfortunate things happen as well. It was a father with his two kids inside and their family followed behind who was extremely distraught. Thank the Lord they were all ok. “The response to assist them was very fast and the bakkie was towed early next morning. That bridge is extremely narrow. Lets spare a thought for someone who had an accident and let’s be grateful for their safety,” she said in the post. ALSO READ: How to keep your pet cool this summer
