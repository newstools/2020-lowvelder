Many children of foreign nationals are termed “undocumented” and do not have the benefit of having a South African birth certificate. Siza Tshabalala looks after these children in the community of Msholozi. She has started an informal school where they spend their day learning basic reading and writing skills, and are taught to become responsible citizens. Most of the children are from poverty-stricken families and are often in need of basic essentials, such as food and clothing. Penryn College learners have been involved in the Msholozi community since 2015, giving their Friday afternoons to play with the little ones in the community.

These boxes were made up by each college tutor group with a specific child in mind,” said Penryn’s marketing department. “We also request that our Penryn community helps Tshabalala by donating pre-loved school shoes (ages six to 15) when replacing their children’s uniforms next year. SPAR is running a promotion whereby if you spend R500 or more, you can buy a pair of Bata school shoes for a reasonably low price. This is another way one can contribute to making Shechem School a success.” Penryn College is founded on the principle of reaching out to the local communities. “Even after such difficult a year, we can give a little to those who have so much less than us, and in so doing, sow something good into the lives of those less-fortunate.” ALSO READ: Lowvelder earns international golden award
