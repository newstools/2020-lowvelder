KLT chairperson, Oupa Pilane said they became aware of places not enforcing social distancing and sanitising. According to him, this is happening in and outside of Mbombela. He mentioned that something especially concerning was that these culprits stay open until after curfew and do not adhere to the capacity legally allowed at their respective establishments at this stage. “We fully understand that businesses have taken a knock and would do anything to recover their losses, including contravening the regulations.

This will have dire consequences for all businesses. “We would like to call on all businesses to act responsibly. We must never be driven by profits to the detriment of all our people who may get infected. “We don’t want the authorities to police us; we must police ourselves as we do not want them to suspend our operations.” KLT, along with the safety cluster and the Department of Health, will randomly visit establishments to assist them with compliance.
