The new Sprinter is so versatile that you’re sure to find just the right variant for your transport tasks, and it looks so good that it’s sure to make a good impression.  Its numerous vehicle variants and broad scope of equipment enable economical entry-level vehicles – with rear-wheel drive, for example – as well as panel vans and freight carrier vehicles tailored precisely to the given operational requirements with exclusively appointed passenger compartments.  Drivers benefit from the intelligent control and display concept which can be matched perfectly to the vehicle’s mode of use – as can the choice of multimedia and assistance systems.  Alongside all these new developments, we have taken care to preserve valuable assets. Many proven body and conversion solutions can remain in use without any major modifications, for example.  As such, the Sprinter applies innovative prowess and more than 20 years of experience to set a new milestone as a pioneering, efficient and reliable mobility solution that will keep your company moving forward.
