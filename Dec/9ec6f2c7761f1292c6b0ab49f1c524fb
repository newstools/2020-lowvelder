She has started the collection of non-perishable items, toiletries and other goodies for Herfsakker, Oranjezicht, Macadamia, Rustig Old Age Home and Rubicon. “I would like to challenge the community to donate to this cause, as there aren’t always family members to help with such needs,” said Swift. She recently visited the old age homes to entertain them with some songs and to dish out some treats. On Tuesday Swift visited Herfsakker at its Christmas party which had platters and donations from Morné Crafford of Frane Scrap, Juan Malan and Recycle It White River. Donations can be made until end of January next year , which the Care Buddies will help to hand out. For more information, please send an email to marketing@lowveldmedia.co.za.
