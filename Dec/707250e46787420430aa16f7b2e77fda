PCA founder and CEO, Dr Andre Hattingh, said although the delivery started off slow due to the heavy rain, they still managed to deliver the parcels.  “A few hours behind schedule we managed to deliver all IDC (Industrial Development Corporation) sponsored food parcels to Katoen and KaBokweni just to rush back to load two tonnes for delivery in Lydenburg first thing Wednesday (December 23) morning,” said Hattingh.
