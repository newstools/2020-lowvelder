The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) has urged water users to be more conservative as Kwena Dam continues on its downward spiral. It now sits below 30%. Kwena, one of the critical dams in the province, supplies Mbombela with its tap water. According to the DWS’ weekly state of reservoirs report of December 14, 2020, Kwena dropped from last week’s 31,3% to 29,5%. This is in contradiction to the provincial average and the water management areas (WMA) that recorded slight improvements. The average levels for the listed dams in Mpumalanga increased from 63,4% to 64,4%. The Olifants WMA increased from 59,1% to 59,3% and the Inkomati-Usuthu WMA increased from 57,1% to 57,4%.
