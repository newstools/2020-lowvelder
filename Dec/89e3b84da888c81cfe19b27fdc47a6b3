The townâ€™s rich history has earned it a well-deserved spot in the annals of history and the Makhonjwa mountain range was declared a world heritage site a few years ago.  A day out with the family to view the wildlife at the Barberton Nature Reserve and enjoy a braai is a great way to spend Christmas Day. Then on to a bit of gold panning to get a first-hand feel of how the early prospectors struck it rich.  For a more adventurous outing, Dusty Tracks offers a 4X4 experience that rivals the best the world has to offer. The Barberton Makhonjwa Geotrail is another interesting example of the rich history the town offers.  It gives visitors a glimpse into the most well-preserved example of the Archaen geological period in the world.  For 4X4 enthusiasts, exploring the historic ghost town known as Eureka City in a jeep or 4 wheel drive vehicle is another popular drawcard. It is 8,f kilometres long and almost 478 vertical metres high for an adrenalin rush comparable to none.  With the beaches at popular holiday destinations across South Africa, closed as a result of the second wave of Covid-19, look no further than outside your doorstep for a wide range of activities that will not break the bank.
