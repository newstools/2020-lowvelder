Mpumalanga Hawks Serious Corruption Investigation Middelburg, together with the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), were executing a sting operation at the municipality for corruption when they made the arrests. Mpumalanga Hawks spokesperson, Captain Dineo Lucy Sekgotodi, said in a press statement that it was alleged motorists had made several complaints about law enforcement officers demanding “gratification for not giving traffic offenders fines after traffic violations”. “It is further alleged that every time the suspects were on duty, they did the same thing. An intelligence driven investigation was initiated in 2019, targeting the same perpetrators,” said Sekgotodi. “In January 2020, an undercover operation was conducted by the team and the same suspects received ‘gratification’ for not issuing traffic fines for traffic violations during the operation. “After finalisation of the investigations the suspects were arrested for the ‘transactions’ in the early hours on Monday while reporting for duty,” she said. The three officers, Gubhela Victor Mkize (59), Johannes Vivian Tlou (53) and Xolani Arnold Nkosi ( 38 ) appeared in the Emalahleni Magistrate’s Court today and they were released on R2 000 bail each. The case has been postponed to March 10, 2021 for further investigation. ALSO READ: Driver of vehicle that crashed into the Crocodile River unharmed
