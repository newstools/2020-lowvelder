Following a recent article in Lowvelder about a land sale in Barberton, AfriForum laid charges of fraud and corruption against the companies implicated in the suspected illegal deal last Friday at the Nelspruit Police Station. The alleged shady land deal involved R34 million and purportedly involved Bongiveli Construction and Vantiblox. Bongiveli Construction is also reportedly linked to the purchase and sale of Rietfontein Farm outside Ermelo that netted it R36,4 million after it was bought for R11,9 million from Fremax Farms, and later sold to the Department of Social Development.

It merely seems as though the transaction was only made to cover up Bongiveli’s involvement.” A deeper investigation by AfriForum’s PPU alllegedly revealed that Bongiveli is also implicated in a fraud case involving the loss of more than R24 million to the Department of Social Development.
