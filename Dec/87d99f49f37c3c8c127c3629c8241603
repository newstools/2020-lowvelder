“If this is the case, you could be doing your home a favour,” said Charnel Hattingh, head of marketing and communications of Fidelity ADT. She explained the value of an alarm system and why it is very important to test your alarm regularly. “The alarm system gives you a peace of mind that your family and possessions are protected. Ensure a 24-hour monitoring if linked to an armed response service provider, for quick response upon activation. “Arm and disarm the system remotely on a smart device. You must also be able to view what is going on at your home on a smart device if the alarm is triggered,” she said. Here are easy steps to keep you home safe: • If you have a home security system or security cameras, make them obvious to potential intruders. • Use lights to create the illusion that someone’s home. You rather use the motion detector lights to illuminate any intruders, or opt for smart lighting so you can set the lights to a timer and control them remotely.• Keep the yard maintained and clean.
