The BFM Gifting Market was held recently at Casterbridge Lifestyle Centre. The community-based artisanal farmers market provided handcrafted and home-made goodies to all the shoppers. “BFM aims to support the local community rather than the large chains, while getting to know one another, making shopping a relaxed, fun and social experience,” said organiser, Rowena Tyson. Shoppers made full use of the morning to support local and took full advantage of the beautiful weather. “We would like to thank our wonderful community for all their support and look forward to seeing them all next year,” concluded fellow organiser, Sue Butowsky.
