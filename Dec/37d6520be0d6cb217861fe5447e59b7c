There are laws that regulate the usage of fireworks and explosives. Members of the community are urged by the SAPS to abide by the law and to report any non-compliance to the police this festive season. Fireworks are regulated in terms of Section 30 of the Explosives Act, 1956 (Act No 26 of 1956). The Explosives Act and Explosives Regulations are administered by the explosives section of SAPS.  Here are things to consider before handling fireworks:• They must be used in designated areas. Never use them in crowded areas or indoors. • See to it that your pets and those of your neighbours have been well secured beforehand.• When purchasing fireworks, do so from stores that are licensed, as they comply with the relevant sections of the Explosives Act.• If a retailer does not have the “Dealer in fireworks” sign and is supplying such products, report them to the police immediately.• Some of the illegal fireworks are identifiable by names such as Indian kings, classic foils, square bombs and cherry bombs. You must steer clear of those and report the sellers immediately. Source: www.saps.gov.za.
