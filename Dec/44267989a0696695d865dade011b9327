The Mpumalanga Association of and for Persons with Disabilities (MAPD) donated single shoes to Disability People of South Africa Mpumalanga Province (DPSA). The shoes will be handed to leg amputees. Each member will receive one formal shoe and one sneaker. A total of 36 single shoes were donated and will be received by 18 beneficiaries. The donation forms part of giving back to the community by the Browse Around Charity Shop currently being operated by the MAPD to benefit persons with disabilities in the province. “It is with great pleasure to partake in the season of giving. Even though it is not much, we hope it will be of great assistance to the beneficiaries. We would like to encourage the community to continue supporting persons with disabilities and work together to ensure that their rights are not violated,” said Randy Sayiya, a MAPD social worker.
