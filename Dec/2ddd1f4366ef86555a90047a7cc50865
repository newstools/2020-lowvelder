The online space is a fully developed marketplace with individuals and businesses trading their goods and services to local and international markets. This unique market has naturally attracted genuine consumers but has also been exposed to people looking to cash in dubiously. The latest to hit the digital market is the scalper bot. Scalper bot refers to software which is used to snap up products which are then resold at a higher price on eBay and Amazon market places. Bots can reload pages quicker than normal consumers with some disguising themselves as hundreds of buyers from different places. Walmart said It blocked more than 20 million bot bids within first 30 minutes of a P S5 sales event. It has also been discovered that collectable sneakers from Nike and other consumer brand products have been targeted. The practice is considered not illegal and bots are readily available online and have proven to be very lucrative for their operators.
