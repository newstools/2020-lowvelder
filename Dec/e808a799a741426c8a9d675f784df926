The service is currently available in Ermelo, Ganala-Kriel, Siyabuswa, Nelspruit, Bosbokrand, Mhluzi, Hendrina, White River, Sonpark, Thulamahashe, Mapulaneng, Mashishing, Malelane, Leraatfontein (Witbank), Standerton, Balfour, Elukwatini, Tonga and Volksrust but will eventually be available to more Post Offices across Mpumalanga. The department indicated that motorists can pay for these services with cash, debit or credit cards. “We are delighted to offer this service in conjunction with the post offices in our province. This project shows how cooperation between government agencies can bring service closer to the people. It will ease the workload on the licensing centres so that employees there will be able to render other services to the community quicker,” the MEC says. Meanwhile post office regional manager, Thomas Mokoatlo says post offices will also be open on Saturdays from 08:00 to 12:30 and this makes it more convenient for people who work during the week. Mokoatlo says it does not matter if you did not receive a renewal notice; the renewal form (ALV) can also be downloaded by clicking on http://www.postoffice.co.za/Products/Domestic/vehiclelicenserenewalform.pdf Vehicle owners need to present an identity document as well as proof of residence when renewing their motor vehicle licence. Fleet owners can drop off their renewal documents and collect their disks later. “The renewal of motor vehicle licences is one of the frequent transactions at post office branches – clear evidence of the success of this service. During the past financial year more than three million motorists renewed their car licences at a post office branch,” Mokoatlo says.
