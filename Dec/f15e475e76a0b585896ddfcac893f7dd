First and foremost it is very important that your pets have enough clean drinking water and ample shade when they are outside. Hopefully you bring your pets inside when it’s too hot, so be sure to have enough water for them there as well! Here are some other ideas to keep them cool. 1. Make a giant ice cube for their water bowl by filling a balloon with water and freezing it overnight. Once completely frozen you can pop it into their water bowl. You can even add a toy or some healthy flavour to make it extra special! 2. Get them a pool to lounge in the shade. You can fill almost any big container with water to allow them to climb in and soak. 3. If you don’t have a container big enough, you can always dampen a towel for them to lie on. Be sure to check the dampness of the towel regularly so that your furry friends can stay cool! 4. Make frozen treats by taking almost any fruit, chopping it up and freezing it along with plain yoghurt. Make sure to only use fruits that are safe and healthy for your dog like banana. If you’re unsure, consult your local vet. Now you have some more ways to keep your pet cool this summer. Have a great time with your paw-children this festive season!
