Leopard Creek, owned by Johan Rupert who allegedly also owns Riverside Farm, is home to the Alfred Dunhill Championship, an internationally recognised golf tournament.  Led by Mpumalanga EFF leader, Collen Sedibe, supporters along with Leopard Creek and Riverside Farm dwellers, marched to Leopard Creek on Friday in the hopes of meeting with Rupert.  However, the group was told that he was not in Malalane and that he could be overseas.

Sedibe said there was currently a land claim in progress at Leopard Creek and Riverside Farm, but that this was in the hands of the government and that was not the purpose of Friday’s march.  He said the management of the two properties had undertaken to respond within the given time period.

It also includes allegations of poor housing conditions for farm workers and dwellers, residential housing being sold without the consent of the owner, racial slurs by white staff against staff and farm dwellers’ children, discrimination against black golfers at Leopard Creek, and that development continues to take place on the two properties despite the ongoing land claim.  Riverside Farm and Leopard Creek were given seven working days to respond to the memorandum. “Failure to respond will be met with a total shutdown of Leopard Creek and Riverside Farm and we will ensure no Dunhill golf will ever take place in Malalane,” said Sedibe.
