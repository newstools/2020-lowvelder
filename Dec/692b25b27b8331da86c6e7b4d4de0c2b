It can be easy to be eco-friendly. You just need to remember that it’s okay not to be perfectly environmentally friendly, as long as you try and make a difference. For example you can start by buying a bamboo toothbrush or using a menstrual cup or reusable pad instead of disposable. You can also take a step back in time and start using cloth diapers for your baby. Here are some ideas to help someone get started on their eco-friendly journey. 1. Reusable bamboo coffee cup:You can find these in most shops. They are durable, reusable and come in super cute designs, which make them an ideal gift. Remind the receiver to take their travel coffee mug with them wherever they go to cut down on paper cups. 2. Bathroom kit:If you’re not sure what to get someone. Get them an eco-friendly bath kit. This kit can include a bamboo toothbrush with tooth bits, bamboo floss, body soap and a shampoo bar. Just About Refills in White River has an online store with most of these things and also does deliveries. 3. Seed pencils:These pencils are available on www.seed-pencils.co.za/ and allow the receiver to write with the pencil until too short, and then to plant the pencil to watch flowers, herbs, or vegetables grow. 4. Dish covers or bees wax wraps:Instead of using plastic wrap, buy specially made dish covers or bees wax wraps from Just About Refills for them to cover their leftovers. These can be reused many times and protect the environment from plastic. 5. Sponges and dish scrubbers:These are environmentally friendly alternatives that anyone can use to wash dishes or clean the kitchen. These can be used countless times instead of non-biodegradable plastic sponges. The sponges and cloths can be thrown in the washing machine when them are dirty. These are also available at Just About Refills.
