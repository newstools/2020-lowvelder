The DIY Wild primate rehabilitation centre near Badplaas looks forward to welcoming international volunteers after the borders reopened. It recently mentioned on its Facebook page that baby season for vervet monkeys has officially started. Up to 25 infants are expected to arrive at its doorstep over the next few months.

This money will go towards his milk and care during his rehab period,” the centre said. If anyone would like to join as a volunteer, they can get in touch with the centre at Info@diywild.com. “Remember, if you can get here before the end of 2020, we are offering a 50 per cent discount as we are desperate for extra hands to help with these babies.”
