Stand too close to throw rocks and start listening to one another. This is the advice of a reconciliation agent, Rev Schalk van Heerden of Fontainebleau in Randburg. He gave this advice after the latest surge of racial tension at Brackenfell High School in the Western Cape, that is threatening to erode South Africaâ€™s already brittle foundation of unity even further. Last Friday, the EFF protested against alleged racism at the school after reports of a whites-only matric dance last month.

After the police fired stun grenades on Friday morning, EFF members regrouped into a large mass for their planned protest near Brackenfell High School. The original agreement was that a maximum of 100 people would be allowed.  Instead, crowds were bussed in by the party. Officials blocked access to the school at three points, hoping to deter the protesters. In the end, they used stun grenades, tear gas, and water cannons to disperse the crowd. This follows closely on the events in Senekal in October, after the murder of young farmer, Brendin Horner, of the farm, Bloukrans near Paul Roux in the Free State.  Some farmers and community members overturned a police vehicle and set it on fire at the first court appearance of the suspects in Senekal. At the second appearance, even more people from all over South Africa gathered. The EFF also weighed in and soon, scuffles had to be disrupted to control an already tense event. SA Human Rights Commissioner, Chris Nissen, said in Brackenfell that South Africa is at a racism turning point and that something should be done. Izak du Plessis asked Van Heerden what he thinks the cause of the tension is and how it can be combatted.  ALSO READ: CEO retreat raises awareness for prostate cancer
