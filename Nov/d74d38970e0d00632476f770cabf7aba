BFM is a farmers’ market. Here, you will only find homegrown, homemade and handcrafted fare. It is a community-based market, aimed at supporting small growers and producers, to showcase what wonderful produce, products and talent the Lowveld has right on its doorstep. Stall holders, bakers, cooks, and crafters are invited to be part of the BFM wholefoods and crafts community so shoppers can rest assured that only quality items will be on sale. The market aims to support the local community rather than the large chains, while getting to know one another, making shopping a relaxed, fun and social experience.
