The Department of Health has launched an investigation into the death of a toddler who allegedly died at M’Africa Clinic while waiting for an ambulance. This follows after a post on Facebook went viral on Wednesday stating how disappointed and hurt a family is because their three-year-old has died. The death is allegedly due to lack of services by the M’Africa Clinic staff members. In the post, Didi Diedie stated that they had taken a toddler to the clinic and they waited for three hours while the toddler was vomiting and allegedly the little one was not attended to. Diedie continued by asking the Department of Health to intervene because the child could have grown to be someone in the community.
