The scourge of  Gender-based violence (GBV)  is rife in South Africa. Since the national lockdown instituted  in March,  many women in abusive relationships have had to endure being cooped up with abusive partners. This is evident in the number of GBV-related court cases and the  murder of women at the hands of their partners during this period. In recognition of the hardships  abused  women endure, the Mpumalanga Provincial Government will launch the 16 Days of Activism for No  Violence Against Women and Children Campaign for 2020 in the City of Mbombela.
