PCA secretary Surika van der Merwe said it applied for the international NGO registration as part of its “continued effort to better assist local children” by offering improved medical services through collaborating with international donors, universities and hospitals across the EU. “Hopefully this will bolster international participation and donations to enable Pediatric Care Africa to offer more to children that deserve and need medical attention, surgeries and special food,” said Van der Merwe.
