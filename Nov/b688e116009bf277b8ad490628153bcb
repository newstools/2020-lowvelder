This is according to Dr Johan Malherbe, a senior researcher at the Agricultural Research Council. “During the last few weeks, the hottest period in the Mbombela region was between November 6 and November 9, when maximum temperatures exceeded 35°C and approached 40°C,” said Malherbe. “These are similar to what was experienced November last year, but October this year was on average about 2° cooler than October 2019.

He said according to current seasonal forecasts, based on an expectation of a relatively wet mid- to late summer, it is expected that temperatures on average during the next few months will be in the normal to below-normal range. “It should therefore, if such a forecast pans out, be somewhat cooler than last year,” he said. Malherbe added that while this year’s summer might be a little cooler, the Lowveld was definitely one of the hottest places to be in Mpumalanga. “Broadly speaking, in Mpumalanga, the hottest area on average is the Lowveld.
