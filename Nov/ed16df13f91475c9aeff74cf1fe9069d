Christabell Cilliers (84) started practicing massage therapy in 1970. She recently held a lunch at Magnolia to celebrate this along with five of her longest standing clients. Four of the five have been her clients for over 32 years. The other, for over 40 years. Cilliers first came to the Lowveld in 1969 when she and her husband lived on a farm in the Burgersfort area. It was in the year after this that she received training as a massage therapist, and some of those same treatments she still uses today.

Cilliers specialises in aromatherapy, but is learned in other treatments such as massage therapy and facials. Cilliers is still fighting fit for her age and regularly goes for walks and still has clients she provides services to. ALSO READ: Circuit manager urges matrics to work hard
