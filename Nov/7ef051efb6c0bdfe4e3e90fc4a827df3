More than 13 years after the brutal death of former South African cycling champion, Etienne van Wyk, a suspect has been arrested in Elukwatini. This was confirmed by Albert Gryvenstein of Bossies Community Justice, who congratulated the members of the serious and organised crime unit at the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) and the police. Van Wyk was murdered and tortured to death in Sputnik Street in Steiltes on January 30, 2007. According to former spokesperson for the the local police, Dawie Pretorius, Van Wyk’s domestic worker and gardener grew suspicious when he did not open the gate that following morning. One of his employees at the time, Denise Rabie, later discovered his body in the dining room. He had multiple wounds to the body and head and had allegedly been strangled. No valuables were reported stolen. The suspect, a 42-year-old male, will appear in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Monday. At this stage, he cannot be named. More details will be published at a later stage.
