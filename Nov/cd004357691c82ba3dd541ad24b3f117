The municipality recently launched “Operation Tatise”, (a siSwati acronym, loosely translated as “Help us know you”/”Let us know you”) where staff will interact with municipal account holders to update information on the City’s billing system.  “The main basic objective of the operation is to ensure the data for customers on our billing system is updated to be accurate and credible”, says municipal spokesperson Joseph Ngala. Ngala said there would be a survey where a few service-delivery questions will be asked of participants to try help the municipal customer-care unit in developing an understanding of how account holders feel about the levels and quality of service offered by CMLM. A minimum of 60 field workers will be appointed to conduct field surveys on behalf of the municipality. Ngala said communities will be informed of these visits and what to expect beforehand.
