According to a recent statement by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA), new tariffs will be implemented for the 2020/21 financial year for its various nature reserves around the province. These tariffs will come into effect from December 1. The MTPA said they will remain largely unchanged to cushion patrons from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and personal spend. “Although we have decided not to increase all the tariffs, we have made adjustments with regard to different pricing for domestic and international tourists. “Covid-19 has had a major impact on the tourism sector at large as such, increasing all tariffs would not be feasible in this financial year,” said Johannes Nobunga, CEO of the MTPA. New tourism activities for specific nature reserves will be introduced and aimed at enhancing the product portfolio and to further attract the domestic market as well as increasing more choices to enhance visitor experience. These activities include, among others, horse riding and mountain biking at Songimvelo Nature Reserve.
