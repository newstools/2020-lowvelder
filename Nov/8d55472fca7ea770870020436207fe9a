Ferreira formed part of numerous organisations in the Lowveld including the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA), Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary and also Friends of Wildlife Management. Condolences have been streaming in from far and wide. Petronel Nieuwoudt of Care for Wild considered him a dear friend and said, “He played a very important part in every step of Care for Wild and the rhinos’ journeys.” ALSO READ: WATCH: Behind the scenes with Kruger’s K9 soldiers Colleagues at the MTPA, Ertjies Röhm and Kholofelo Nkambule, also spoke fondly of Ferreira. Nkambule said she had worked with him for many years and that he “was such a remarkable man who was passionate and dedicated to his work. He has left a big gap”. Röhm said the cancer surfaced last year. “It started in his bladder, but was removed. He recovered almost completely, but during the year experienced some pain in his stomach – the cancer had then spread to his glands. “It is difficult, but we saw it coming.” Read more on Dr Ferreira du Plessis in this week’s Lowvelder.
