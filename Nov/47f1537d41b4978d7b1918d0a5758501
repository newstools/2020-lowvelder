The first of its kind was held in White River last year. The organisers had hoped to grow it even bigger this year, but due to Covid-19, that was not possible. Regardless, the show, held on 31 October, sold out at the allowed 250 tickets. A total of 23 wine farms were represented by representatives from Mpumalanga, Johannesburg and even the Cape.  Aside from being treated to delicious wines, Lowvelders could also enjoy food prepared by the Jock as well as live music to complete the atmosphere.

Lundie said the basic idea is to expose people to a variety of wine farms. Schoeman added to this and said they want to create the opportunity where if you taste a wine and you like it, you buy it right then and there and take it home with you. Covid-19 regulations surrounding alcohol sales posed a challenge, but this was easily overcome. People could purchase wines if they intended to consume it on site. Arrangements were then also made to place orders that would be delivered during the allowed delivery hours. Organisers hope to go back to the intended structure of the show next year.
