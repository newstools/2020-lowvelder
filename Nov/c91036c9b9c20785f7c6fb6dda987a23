The Nelspruit SPCA gave a massive thank you to Gary Friend and the team at Hi-Q Nelspruit after they tended to the organisation’s vehicle. “They gave some much-needed attention to our Hyundai bakkie. They generously did a whole list of repairs for free.” Hi-Q did some work on the brakes, gearbox and also replaced all four tyres. “Thank you for taking care of our wheels so we can focus on the paws.” ALSO READ: Search for missing KNP field ranger continues Should anyone wish to help the SPCA in any other way, they can contact the office on 013-753-3582 or simply donate to the organisation directly.
