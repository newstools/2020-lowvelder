The tech giant took that first step Tuesday when it announced a new line of Macs with chips designed in-house, ditching a 15-year relationship with its old chip supplier Intel. These new chips designed by Apple – called the M1- will allow app developers to create families of apps that work on both computers and phones. This new incredible efficiency also offers exceptional battery life with up to 15 hours of wireless Internet surfing and up to an astonishing 18 hours of video playback, which is six hours longer than before. And if your video conferencing can drain the battery quickly, you can on a single charge drive up to twice as long. “The M1 chip is by far the most powerful chip we have ever developed. This makes these Macs significantly faster, offers brand new features with exceptional battery life, and allows the Mac to run more software than ever before, ” said Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple hopes all of this will boost Mac sales. Apple’s global market share in the third quarter was just 8 percent, compared to double-digit numbers for Windows-based PCs from Lenovo, Dell and HP.
