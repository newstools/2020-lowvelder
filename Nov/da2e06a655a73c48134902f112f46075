This week, Bheki Cele, minister of police, said that the police forked out millions of rand to ensure Mabuza’s safety. Cele’s revelation came after the DA spokesperson of tourism, Manny de Freitas, asked for a breakdown of the cost to protect Mabuza during the Covid-19 lockdown. Cele confirmed that there are 28 highly trained policemen on Mabuza’s protection detail. The R8,4 million was for meals, incidental costs and accommodation, and excluded salaries and other benefits. The funding of the protection services comes out of the police budget. From April 1 until September 30, R6,2 million was spent on accommodation (mainly hotels and luxury lodges), R900 000 on transport and more than R884 000 on “incidental” costs.

Lowvelder established that one of these locations was the “Farm”, Mabuza’s private residence outside Barberton, on the Alma smallholdings. In a statement, De Freitas said the amount was “ridiculous” to spend on one man. “Why can’t they have one or two protectors each?” said De Freitas.  He said the money could have been better spent on other more important and crucial services.
