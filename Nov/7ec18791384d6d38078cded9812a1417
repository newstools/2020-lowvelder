SARS will receive payment of its claim before concurrent creditors will. However, in business rescue the situation is different in that SARS enjoys the same rights and entitlements as any other concurrent creditor. This was confirmed in the matter between SARS v Beginsel, where it was held that SARS must be treated the same way as any other concurrent creditor in business-rescue proceedings. This came after SARS argued that its status as a preferent creditor in terms of the Insolvency Act meant that its claims would rank ahead of ordinary concurrent creditors. The court held that the Companies Act, which regulates business-rescue proceedings, does not create statutory preferences as set out in the Insolvency Act and that, if the legislature had intended to prefer SARS above other creditors in business-rescue proceedings, it would have explicitly stated so.  Accordingly, the court held that SARS is not a preferent creditor in business rescue as it would be in a liquidation. The most important reason behind the ranking of SARS as a concurrent creditor is summarised in Section 7(k) of the Companies Act, which states that the purpose of business rescue is to efficiently rescue and recover companies experiencing financial distress. If SARS had the opportunity of enjoying preferent status, it would leave the company with very little to distribute to concurrent creditors.  Although this judgement created an unfamiliar position for SARS, it reaffirms the spirit and purpose of business-rescue proceedings. Furthermore, SARS should play an active role in the business-rescue proceedings to ensure that the troubled company continues trading and loss of employment is avoided.
