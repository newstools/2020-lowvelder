An unemployed man (27) has pleaded guilty to assaulting his mother. This came after he had been accused of stealing money in the house. “I am remorseful to this honourable court and request that it will be lenient with me when passing its sentence,” said Ngutshane in his pleading statement. Mashabane testified that he had strangled her while assaulting her and she fell to the ground. She asked the court to release her son, but he must not come anywhere near her. Mashabane told the court that as a mother she will continue to provide for his needs, but at an RDP house away from her home which the family has decided to give to him.

The court is also aware that most kinds are mediated or withdrawn because they involve mothers and sons. Issues of femicide are a pandemic themselves and the public looks to the courts for protection and justice,” he said. Mabunda sentenced Ngutshane to six months in prison or the option to pay a R5 000 fine. Half of the sentence was suspended for two years, provided the accused was not found guilty of assault again. He was also declared unfit to possess a firearm.
