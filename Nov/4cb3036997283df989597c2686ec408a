Quanis Accounting and Tax Solutions held a small-business compliance workshop recently in Nkomazi. “Many small companies, especially in rural areas, were unable to apply for the relief after the devastating effects of Covid-19.” “It troubled me as an accountant seeing directors running very profitable businesses, but clueless on issues of compliance,” said Sabelo Mkhwanazi, owner of Quanis Accounting and Tax Solutions. “I decided to host the workshop of small businesses to teach the basics about registering companies using Bizportal, compliance with SARS, the department of labour, and each industry in which each business operates.” Mkhwanazi went on to say that although some small businesses can afford to have lawyers and accountants, SARS and CIPC still hold directors of companies liable should things go wrong. “The workshop was to be an eye-opener to all directors and shareholders about their duties and responsibilities, the need to be accountable and the need to understand what returns are filed on their behalf.” ALSO READ: PCA helps with corrective shoes for little girl
