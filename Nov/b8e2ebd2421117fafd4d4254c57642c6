Uplands College Honours Evening for 2020 took place digitally this year. “Following Covid-19 regulations, it would have been impossible to accommodate the entire school body, teachers, parents and families in the school hall. To this end, with some 2020 insight and hindsight, Uplands embraced technology and for the first time hosted the Honours Evening online,” said Sandile Maluleke, head of communications at Uplands. The focus was on the grade 12 top achievers in all spheres of school life and many pupils received awards for academics, sport and service. The dux scholar of 2020, Ceilidh Ferguson, addressed her peers and encouraged them to work hard and make the most of their experience at Uplands.
