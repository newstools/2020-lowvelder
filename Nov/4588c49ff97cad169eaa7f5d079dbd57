The Care Buddy members met at the Mataffin Macadamia Lifestyle and Assisted Living Village in Mbombela with several packages of toiletries and some snacks for a number of people living in the village. “We visit the people in the homes and spoil them,” said Care Buddies chairperson Meisie Barnard. “They love it and really appreciate it, and we love visiting them,” she said. Barnard said they would have had a Christmas lunch for the residents, but due to the pandemic, they had to put the festive meal on hold. However, the Care Buddies recently received a massive donation of toiletries from Unilever which they used to make up care packages for 263 elderly people.

It was very difficult for both the elderly and for the Care Buddies, because we are like family,” said Barnard.

To experience the joy and companionship of these special people really just fills our hearts with pure gratitude for the opportunity and to be able to make a difference in their lives,” she said.
