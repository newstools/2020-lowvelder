At 07:00, hikers left from the Bridal Veil Falls in groups of 10 and started the steep climb on the Loerie Hiking Trail. The aim of the event was to take a stand against gender-based violence (GBV). According to Elsa Lategan who was team leader for the Lowveld Ramblers on the day, a total of R1 100 was raised by the club and donated to the Lungile Mango Foundation that supports victims of GBV.  Apart from ramblers, the hike was also attended by Safcol employees and external stakeholders, with the aim of creating a platform where people got to engage and challenge this scourge.

The company is against such incidents, as mentioned by President Cyril Ramaphosa during his address on June 17, “The perpetrators of GBV live and walk among us; they are our fathers, brothers, sons and friends; violent men with no regard for the sanctity of human life.”
“We therefore encourage everyone to break the silence by reporting and acting against abuse,” said Safcol.
