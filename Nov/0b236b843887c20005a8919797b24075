Various stalls selling everything from food and jewellery, to children’s educational books were set up at the bottom of the church grounds near a small babbling stream surrounded by trees, creating a natural canopy for customers and stallholders alike. Friends, families and kids enjoyed their day in the sun with several visitors to the market throughout the day. ALSO READ: Lowveld Media staff and SANBS work together to collect blood As well as selling a variety of educational children’s toys and books, Clamber Club’s stallholder, Yolandé Powell, used the opportunity to raise funds for baby MJ Erasmus, who was born in early September with a rare birth defect that affects his brain. Funds are also being raised by Lowveld community members for an extensive genetic test, namely Whole Exome Sequencing, that can only be conducted in America.
