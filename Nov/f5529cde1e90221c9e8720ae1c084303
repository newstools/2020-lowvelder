Nestle is putting something new on the menu for your four-legged friend. The Swiss giant is to start making pet food from insects. Set to launch this month, the Purina Beyond Natureâ€™s Protein range comes in two flavours. Nestle says bug-based food is more environmentally friendly, as it reduces dependence on conventional meat. The new pet food was developed taking into consideration the different nutritional requirements of cats and dogs, as well as their different taste profiles. The protein sources were blended to deliver all essential amino acids dogs and cats need, with different levels of insect proteins for each. The move addresses a trend of people seeking more eco-friendly or allergen-free diets for their pets Nestle expects strong demand from eco-conscious consumers.
