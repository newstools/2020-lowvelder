Lize Pienaar, vice-chairperson and member of the previous committee, reminded supporters of what the SPCA stands for: Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “Our mission is in our name: to prevent cruelty to animals. By conducting regular inspections at all facilities where they are kept, bred, trained, displayed, slaughtered or used, we can take corrective steps where concerns are detected. “We also act against people who contravene the law, firstly via education and advice, and in worst case scenarios, prosecution takes place if warnings have been ignored. In some severe cases immediate action is required.” ALSO READ: Hi-Q Nelspruit keeps SPCA moving Pienaar said the SPCA believes that animals are sentient beings and that they suffer physically and mentally if all their needs are not met. This is based on the five freedoms of animals, namely:• freedom from pain, injury and disease• freedom from hunger and thirst• freedom from discomfort• freedom from fear and distress• freedom to express normal behaviour. “The SPCA is governed by law and because of this there are many regulations and rules we have to adhere to. All of these are necessary to ensure the best interest of all animals.” She mentioned that due to the legal basis on which the SPCA operates, it cannot be compared with other animal welfare organisations.

We will be their voice,” Pienaar said.
