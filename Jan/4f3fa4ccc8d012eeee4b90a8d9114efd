 MBOMBELA – St Mark’s International School added first added primary school classes in the middle of 2018, and had made huge renovations since. This week, they were able to welcome even more learners. The admission numbers were likely to increase over the next 10 days, as many public schools in town are at capacity. While the primary school is still in its baby shoes, the primary phases are totally separated from the high school. WATCH: Your blood can save a life They have been hard at work installing and painting palisade fences, planting grass, adding jungle gyms for the little ones and ensuring wheelchair access. A massive development is planned for the surrounding area after the City of Mbombela Local Municipality announced last year that the land, also home to the Nelspruit Rugby Club, will be developed for upmarket housing. However, the city council have resolved that the developer is required to relocate them to suitable premises, at the developer’s own cost, should this come to pass. Parents may thus rest assured that the school is in no danger of closure. They decided to add a primary school to their existing high school, with hostels, due to demand from the public who struggle to find space in government schools.
