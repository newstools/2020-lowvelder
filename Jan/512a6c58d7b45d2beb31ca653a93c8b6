 MBOMBELA – Eskom has announced that load-shedding will persist until 05:00 on Monday. Initially it was instituted from 22:00 last night, due to the conveyor belt failure. Although the conveyor belt has since been repaired, the loss of additional generating units as well as the depletion of Eskom’s diesel and pump storage levels have forced the power utility to implement stage 2 load-shedding for today. “We continue to ask customers to reduce demand as a concerted collective effort, in order to avoid or reduce the level of load-shedding.” It is likely to continue during the course of next week. Eskom stated, “We will give South Africans regular updates about our prognosis for tomorrow and our recovery efforts for the week ahead.” ALSO READ: Municipality battling to honour Eskom payments Please see the stage 2 load-shedding schedule for today: 09:00-11:30

Due to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages,” the issued statement by Eskom read. Eskom reminded its customers that load-shedding is a crucial measure to ensure that the integrity of the power grid is not compromised. ALSO READ: Eskom shares its summer plan to keep the lights on
