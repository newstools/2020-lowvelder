 MBOMBELA – Martie Laas, a qualified nurse, volunteer and former employee of the goodwill organisation, explained that they are selling honey and bottled green figs to generate funds for the care and support of community members who are unwell. “There is a common misconception that we only assist the terminally ill, but we support all sick people, regardless of their age. We are at this moment helping a 12-year-old who has cancer,” she said. One of the managers at Crossing SUPERSPAR, on whose premises the stand was assembled, came to lend a helping hand. Dee Ordway described Nelspruit Hospice as an amazing organisation and stated that “without the support of the community, many people would be left destitute. That is the reason why I came to help with the marketing of the products”.

One of the volunteers, Drene Ramsay, is 73 years young. “I have been helping the public for 10 years now, because that is what I do. If you can’t help your next of kin, stop living. It’s a blessing to help someone in need,” she said.
The public can buy 375 millilitres of honey at the Hospice at 84 Ferreira Street, Mbombela, or during fundraising initiatives, at R65 a bottle. ALSO READ: Hospice brings happiness to all their patients
