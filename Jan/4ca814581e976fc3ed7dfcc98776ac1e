 These were the words one of the residents of the KaNyamazane community, Mountain View section, this afternoon at a protest. About 15 men marched, danced and sang in front of Silulumanzi in town. The protesters demanded a 24-hour supply of water for their community. These people are said to currently receive their water supply bi-weekly. A protester said the company had promised to get back to them about their request in December, however, no one has given them feedback regarding their discussion. “We are not here to fight or touch anything, we just want our rights, we want to know what’s going on,” he told Lowvelder. He further said there is an organisation that wants to provide flushing toilets for the community, but that Silulumanzi is delaying this process. “We live in an urban area, they can give the outside toilets to the people in the rural areas,” he added. Richmond Jele, the public relations manager of Silulumanzi, said indeed they had had a meeting with the residents. The organisation and its management visited the site.

But every time we do that, another community suffers,” he explained. Jele added that there are residents from informal settlements around the area who illegally tap into water sources and this disrupts the supply.

When it is empty we refill it again,” he concluded.
