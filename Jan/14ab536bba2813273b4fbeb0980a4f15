 Nissan demonstrated the new lightweight sound insulation material, known as acoustic meta-material, at CES 2020 in Las Vegas. The make-up of the new material is simple. A combination of a lattice structure and plastic film controls air vibrations to limit the transmission of wide frequency band noise (500 to 1 200 hertz), such as road and engine noise. Currently, most materials used to isolate this frequency band consist mainly of heavy rubber board.

Because of its simple structure, the material’s cost competitiveness in terms of mass-production is almost the same as, or possibly better than, current materials. Therefore, the material can also be applied to vehicles where the use of sound insulation materials is currently limited due to cost or weight.  Nissan started its research on meta-material technology around 2008. At the time, meta-material was used in high-sensitivity antennas used for electromagnetic wave research. Nissan worked to extend the applicability of meta-material technology to include sound waves, leading to the successful invention of acoustic meta-material. Making vehicles lighter helps limit the environmental impact of driving by improving energy efficiency. It also enhances enjoyment, as the quiet vehicle cabin makes driving more comfortable.
