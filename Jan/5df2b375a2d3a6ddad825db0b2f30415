 MBOMBELA – Komatipoort Akademie was taken by surprise when they were announced as the top achieving school in the Lowveld for 2019. According to principal Ormond Lombaard, they are usually in the top 20, but this year they were overwhelmed by the news that they outshone a number of other top local schools. He said there were a number of learners who failed the June exams, which caused them to have to come up with a new strategy and divert more attention to those who were falling behind. “We offered them extra classes, went through the exam papers with them every afternoon and mainly focused on what they struggled with,” he told Lowvelder.
