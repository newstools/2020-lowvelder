The purpose of the shutdown is to conduct fault finding from the reservoir to the delivery bulk lines to the Eskom pump station. “The pumps are currently not delivering adequate volumes to the CBD reservoirs and further up to the Numbi reservoirs, thereby adversely affecting the water supply programme,” the notice states. “The plant will be stopped and the entire system will be emptied. Domestic and business consumers are advised to use water sparingly and to cooperate with the City during the outage.” ALSO READ: Seven suspected rhino poachers arrested in KNP
