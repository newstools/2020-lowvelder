 A woman who was allegedly kidnapped and assaulted claimed she had to wait several hours before the local police assisted her to open a case against her attacker. “I arrived in the Lowveld on the Friday, as it was my grandmother’s funeral on Sunday. On my arrival here I found out that my younger half-sister had been missing for two weeks.” She said that she had no idea where her half-sister was but that a family member started phoning her with accusations that the child was with her, and that she knew the whereabouts of the girl.

Col Donald Mdluli, police spokesperson, said the case number given correlated with a case of theft, but said that he would investigate.
