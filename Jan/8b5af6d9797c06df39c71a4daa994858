 MBOMBELA – The SPCA Nelspruit has launched a build-a-wall challenge. The non-profit organisation has suffered several break-ins, which have badly damaged its fence. It is therefore embarking on a project to build a wall around the premises. The most recent break-in occurred last week, when thieves broke off taps, stole hosepipes, took spotlights, and in the process broke windows and gates.

The SPCA is situated between the KaNyamazane turnoff and the industrial area. Even as Botha showed Lowvelder the footpath and where the fence had been broken, people walked through and kept on walking when Botha told them it was private property.  “We could use this space for our animals, but are afraid that they will get stolen or hurt,” said Pienaar. Anything can be donated that will speed up the building process. People can donate bricks, cement, building sand and concrete or money.
