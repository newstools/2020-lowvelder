 MBOMBELA – Spending four hours to renew one’s licence requires a lot of patience – not to mention the loss of productivity of taking leave during a working day. This was the reaction of one frustrated local resident who became too frustrated trying to renew his licence on Thursday – after his wallet had been stolen – that he took this video in frustration.  “There were people at some of the counters, but clients could not be helped because the system was offline. It is a pity that this was not communicated at all.” ALSO WATCH: Class of 2019’s matric results It is understood that the Barberton, White River and Malalane offices were also closed on Thursday, causing even more traffic at the Mbombela branch. Municipal spokesman, Joseph Ngala, did not respond to the newspaper’s request for comment as of publication.
