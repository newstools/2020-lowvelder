 MBOMBELA – This dispute also resulted in the blockading of the N4 between Cairn and Halls on Saturday evening. According to Brig Leonard Hlathi, the electricity in Mataffin was off for most of Saturday. It was speculated that it was switched off because of illegal connections. Lazarus Muthimba, a spokesman at Eskom, has since confirmed that the power was off, although not because Eskom switched it off. “The power supply to Mataffin tripped, resulting in an unplanned power outage. Upon investigation by Eskom, it was discovered that the root cause was illegal connections. The illegal connections have to be removed before supply can be restored,” Eskom mentioned in a press release yesterday. “On Saturday January 11, some members of the Mataffin community decided to conduct the illegal act of occupying certain Eskom premises and blocking off roads in protest to force Eskom to restore electricity supply in their area. These protest actions are unlawful.” ALSO READ: Mbombela licensing offices offline, again The community of Mataffin started protesting around 17:00.
