 Pro-Life Pet Rescue started an initiative whereby people can exercise rescue dogs and give them exposure to the public at the Halls parkrun once a month. The first outing was a success with nine rescue dogs going to the parkrun. Dogs which work well together will go on this trip. According to Elise Erasmus, the canines loved this outing and were very tired afterwards. Erasmus said they will do it more frequently if there is a lot of interest. They are fully booked until March. ALSO READ: Non-profit organisation sells sweet produce to help the sick
