 MBOMBELA – Community members took to social media to voice their frustration after they were refused entry to the hospital parking lot by security officers. There is a small informal area that they now have to make use of outside Rob Ferreira, that is usually filled to capacity.  Patients who do not get space here have to park at Sonpark Shopping Centre and cross a busy road. A 60-year-old patient, who did not want to be named, said getting into the hospital has become a challenge. “I am getting old and I am sick. Walking to the hospital is not safe for me. I also have a big bag to carry and carrying it is difficult.” Another elderly patient (70) who also wanted to remain anonymous, complained that two of her friends in their 70s had to park at Sonpark. “They were there to consult a physiotherapist. They are old and need to have their knees replaced. Imagine them having to walk a long distance before being assisted,” she told Lowvelder. Malamule said the decision to keep visitors from parking in the hospital’s parking lot was made by management after several instances where nurses were abused, intimidated and threatened, had occurred. “We figured the only way to stop people from smuggling weapons into the premises, was to restrict access to the parking lots,” he said. He further explained that cars will be allowed access only if it is an emergency.
