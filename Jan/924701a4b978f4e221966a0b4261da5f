According to Theresa Mabuyi, the principal of the school, the Department of Education enforces that the foundation phase, grade Rs to threes, are taught mainly in their home language, siSwati.  “When these learners progress to grade four they are introduced to learning in English. Many of them struggle to gain an understanding of the language and they eventually do not do well enough to be promoted to the next grade, therefore have to repeat the class,” Mabuyi explained. She came up with the project alongside her Partner for Possibility partner, to prepare learners for the next phase. “In the bus the medium of instruction is English. All activities that will be done, such as story reading, educational videos, and so on will be in English,” she explained. The Hloni bus will be launched on Sunday February 2.
