 Johan van Helsdingen has been a missionary in Mozambique for the past 23 years. “I have planted 12 churches, three mission bases and mission schools,” he said. Van Helsdingen has given up his duties in Mozambique, “to answer the call God has given me many years ago. That is to come back to South Africa to give a message to churches and Christians”. He explained to Lowvelder that the church is divided into three generations. The first generation is the one that serves God wholeheartedly with its family. The second one has compromised and the third is lost. His message to South Africa is: “We must bring the second and third generations back to God, modelling the first generation”.

The pastor has money which will sustain him for the next couple of months, however, “I will rely on churches for donations and contributions for the rest of the journey”.
