SANParks urged all visitors to exercise extreme caution when approaching low-lying bridges, and not to use roads with no-entry signs.  The good rainfall, however, did little for the dwindling water levels of the dams in the Lowveld.
Several of the bigger dams are still far under capacity, and even lower than they were this time last year. Both Kwena and Primkop dams are both critically low. Kwena is at approximately 38 per cent, but should be at about 60 to 80 per cent of the full storage capacity (FSC) this time of year. A year ago the dam was at 39 per cent. Primkop is currently at approximately 29 per cent and should be between 80 to 90 per cent FSC. Last year the dam reached about 40 per cent.
