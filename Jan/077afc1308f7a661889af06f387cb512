 WHITE RIVER – Pediatric Care Africa (PCA) is going on a charity bike ride next month. Ride for a Child is intended to generate funds for 1 000 surgeries for 1 000 children. Dr Andre Hattingh, the founder of PCA, will ride his Harley-Davidson bike around South Africa, an approximate distance of 5 600 kilometres. The route Dr Hattingh will be riding through during the campaign Hattingh discussed with Lowvelder there is a misconception about bikers. Bikers, at first sight, are assumed as rough and aggressive. However, “many bikers are generally, extremely generous and protective over children” he explained. He further says that there is no discrimination between bikers. People of all races, gender and ages ride bikes, so this bridges the differences between all nationalities. This made it the perfect fun activity to choose for this campaign. PCA hopes to raise  R500 000 during this campaign. Hattingh explained that the surgeries will be split between 500 children in South Africa and 500 children in Mozambique.

PCA further explained that guest bike riders can be sponsored for R1 per kilometre by a friend,  a company or themselves. Hattingh, being a grandfather to four grandchildren, purposefully challenged grandparents all over the country to ride along with him. He will be accompanied by a support vehicle departing from Mugg & Bean at White River Crossings on February 15 at 09:00 and plans to arrive back on March 5.
