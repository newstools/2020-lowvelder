 The Lowveld National Botanical Garden is free for pensioners  every Tuesday. A group of local pensioners has started an informal walking club called Lekker stap. They have met for the past 15 months at Tindlovu at the garden gate on a Tuesday just before 08:30. Founding member Santie Barrish said she started this initiative, because pensioners feel unsafe walking alone. “Lekker stap gives pensioners the opportunity to walk and socialise in the company of like-minded people.” She explained that from the gate, they meander over the bridge of the Crocodile River towards the African rainforest, and they enjoy the spectacular view of the Cascade Waterfalls.

Johan Potgieter, a pensioner who joins the walk, told Lowvelder that Lekker stap is a wonderful experience. “It is refreshing; we get good exercise and enjoy nature. We also have good company.” The groups walks at the slowest person’s pace. Afterwards they have tea or coffee accompanied by excellent conversation. “We have interesting, informative talks,” he said. Barrish explained to Lowvelder that the number of pensioners that attends on a Tuesday morning are between 10 and 12. The invitation is open to all pensioners to come and join in the fun. Interested pensioners need to be registered on a WhatsApp group, so they can inform the people that they will attend. Enquiries: Santie Barrish at santiebarrish@gmail.com.
