 • Make sure that everyone moves away from the snake and don’t attempt to kill or capture it. • Try to identify the snake – get a good description or take a picture with your cell phone if it is safe. • Should someone have been bitten keep them calm while waiting for help – stress and fear increase blood flow, spreading the venom more rapidly. • Call for help immediately or take the victim to the closest emergency room or hospital. • Always keep the bitten limb below the heart – it slows blood flow and the spread of venom. • Do not give the victim anything to eat or drink, especially alcohol! Alcohol will speed up the absorption of venom.

Snake experts warn that doing this may cause further damage and increase the risk of infection. • Never try to suck out the venom. Suction by mouth can be dangerous as venom may enter the mouth via a wound. • Never apply a pressure bandage if you don’t know what snake it is and what the effect of the venom is. Some snake bites cause extreme swelling and applying a pressure bandage can do more harm than good. ALSO READ: Swimming pool safety and CPR
