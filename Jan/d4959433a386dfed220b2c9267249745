 BUSHBUCKRIDGE – According to Brig Leonard Hlathi, the provincial police spokesman, reports indicate that the victim was celebrating New Year’s Eve with his wife and family at their home, when an unknown assailant entered their yard with a firearm. The murder suspect shot the man several times and then went on to shoot the victim’s wife before fleeing the scene. “The mortally wounded man and his wife were rushed to the nearby clinic for medical attention and in the process, the police were summoned to the scene as well. It is unfortunate that the man was certified dead on arrival at the clinic. However, the woman is recovering in hospital,” Hlathi said. Hlathi stated that a case of murder as well as attempted murder have been opened and that the detectives have already commenced with their investigation. “The motive for the killing is unknown at this stage and no arrests have been made as yet,” he said.
