 Mataffin residents were reported to have had no electricity yesterday, allegedly shut down due to illegal connections, which ultimately led to protest action. According to Brig Leonard Hlathi, SAPS were on the scene between 17:00 and 18:00 yesterday. In this time an Eskom official was also on the scene to negotiate with the community. The dispute was settled, only to have the power cut off later in the evening, which resulted in members of the community barricading the N4, between Cairn and the ring road, between 23:50 and 00:50. SAPS were once again on the scene.

Protesters were also throwing rocks at vehicles and caused an accident. “We don’t have a problem with protesting, however, we would like to remind the public that it should be done in a legal manner – without causing damage to other people’s property,” Soares commented. No one was arrested during the protest action. ALSO READ: Copper thief caught red-handed Lowvelder contacted Eskom for a comment and is waiting on its reply.
