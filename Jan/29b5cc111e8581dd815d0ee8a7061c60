 Trans African Concessions would like to advise the public that it is aware of the severe infrastructure damage between the OR Tambo and Highveld Steel Interchanges in the Highveld area. The damage is due to the theft of steel lining in the pipe culverts, which has resulted in erosion. TRAC has inspected the affected culverts and the relevant section of the road and assures the public that the road is stable and is not collapsing as has been rumoured. Also read: Accused will reappear in court for theft case Major repair work to address the matter will commence soon, in conjunction with the rehabilitation and upgrade project of Sections N4-3 and N4-4, between the OR Tambo and the Van Dyksdrift Interchanges. The infrastructure along the N4 Toll Route continues to be severely affected by theft and malicious damage, which is strongly condemned by TRAC. Such actions not only result in the company incurring unnecessary costs but also have a negative impact on the road’s maintenance and traffic flow. TRAC urges members of the public to report crimes against TRAC and its infrastructure to its Whistle Blower Hotline on 082 900 2447. Callers can remain anonymous. Road users can also contact TRAC’s 24-hour Helpdesk on 0800 87 22 64 or via email at helpdesk@tracn4.co.za to report theft and damage to property.
