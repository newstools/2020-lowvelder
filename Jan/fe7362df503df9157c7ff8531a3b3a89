 Images of the cat can’t be shown due to harshness. According to Lize Pienaar, chairperson of Nelspruit SPCA, they are used to extreme cruelty, but this really left them speechless. The cat showed hypersalivation, foaming around the mouth, breathing difficulty and very disturbing convulsions. He also had open sores on his body.

The SPCA suspects that the cat may have been poisoned, but cannot confirm it. The cat was humanely euthanised to end its suffering. The SPCA reminds people that feral cats are domestic cats that had been abandoned and the offspring are wild and scared of people. They are found at food sources like hotels, restaurants, shopping centres and garbage bins.

They are often run over by vehicles and are susceptible to various diseases. “They are often seen as a nuisance. But they are just innocent animals fighting for a life and a place in the sun,” Pienaar said. Contact the SPCA if you would like to join their feral cat project.
