This is wrong. Even cooler days out in the sun require protection and it needs to be a priority. Nikki Flanagan from Everysun gives a few tips on how to protect yourself from the heat this festive season. “It’s a daily job, despite the weather, to protect your skin from potential sun damage,” said Flanagan. Here are some tips to help keep you safe in the sun without compromising on the fun: • Use a high SPF sunscreen. • Apply sun lotion every hour to keep your skin protected. • Apply sunscreen everywhere. • Make sure you cover your entire body, even between your toes and behind your ears. UV rays bounce around, so every inch of your body needs protection.
