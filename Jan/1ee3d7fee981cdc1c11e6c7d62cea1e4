 The power system is under stress this morning and Eskom is using diesel generators to meet the demand. “While we have adequate emergency reserves to supplement capacity during the day, we may need to implement load-shedding this evening in order to augment diesel and water at our open-cycle gas turbines and pumped storage schemes respectively,” read a statement issued by the company. Unplanned outages were at 13 063 MW as at 06:30 this morning, slightly up from 12 620 MW yesterday.

Keeping generation-unit breakages below 9 500 MW is part of a plan to manage our ageing fleet and bring stability back into the power system.” Eskom requested its customers to work with them by reducing their demand while the company works on stabilising the power system.
