The man with the big heart and big beard is treating fans to a fantastic performance to start out the new decade on a high note.  Jo Black, who performed at Afrikaans is Groot to scores of thrilled fans, is a platinum-selling artist with over 15 million views on YouTube. Now he is coming to Mbombela.  He combines moving, raw and honest pub rock with inspirational messages, which sends each listener home with new hope. Jo Black, born Jo Engelbrecht, grew up in Pretoria North and started working after school. He ran his own construction company where, for approximately 8 years, he built everything from roads and bridges to hospitals and houses. Jo soon realised that there is more to life than just work, and things took an about-turn. Jo’s musical performance is easy listening pub music, and the inspirational songs will leave you with a smile and wanting more.
