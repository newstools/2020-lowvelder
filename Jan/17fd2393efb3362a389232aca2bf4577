 MBOMBELA – The SANBS depends on schools, universities, businesses and individuals to collect the level of blood required to meet demand in hospitals. Lebo Matsimbi, a donor-relations practitioner, explained to Lowvelder they held a competition last year in which the school that donates the most blood units wins a prize.  Bergvlam was the winner, donating 340 blood units. “We will continue with the competition this year,” she said. All leaners should bring a copy/cellphone picture of their ID/birth certificate when donating at school blood drives.
