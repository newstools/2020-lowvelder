 Potholes can be found on every street and are becoming bigger, deeper and increasingly dangerous for motorists. They are seemingly not being repaired. Sanley van der Merwe, DA caucus leader and ward councillor, commented that every year a budget is allocated: generally the national treasurer recommends eight per cent allocation towards maintenance and upgrading of existing assets for a local municipality. However, the city struggles with affordability and therefore budgets are below the norm for this expenditure type. In the previous years, five per cent was budgeted, but for this financial year (2020/21) it is significantly lower. Budget allocation for the maintenance of roads was cut by almost 50 per cent. “I believe this was motivated by the financial situation of the municipality. It remains a serious concern.” She added that the mayor has indicated that an earlier adjustment budget will be called, “but I doubt that this will include an increase on maintenance budgets or any other expenditure types.
