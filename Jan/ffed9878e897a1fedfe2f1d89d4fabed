He was a loyal child and he loved his sport, especially hockey.” “Heunis was ‘n man met groot drome en ‘n mooi hart. Hy het altyd tyd vir sy vriende en vriendinne gehad en sou hulle altyd eerste stel. Hy was baie lief vir sy sport, en jy sou hom nooit sien stilsit nie. Sy liefde vir sy familie en gesin was besonders. Ek en Heunis kom al 21 jaar saam, en hy was, is en sal nog altyd my beste pel wees. Die pad is vir my swaar sonder hom. Ons almal sal hom onthou as die man met die mooi hart en groot glimlag wat altyd gelukkig was. Ek is so lief vir jou, Heunis.” – Biance.
