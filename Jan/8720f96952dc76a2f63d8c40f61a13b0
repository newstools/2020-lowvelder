 MBOMBELA – The event consisted of seven acts throughout the evening, each act lasting around half an hour. Margaret Adams, of Rock Tot Music Blog, arranged the event. “The evening was a success, and Steve Gröbler and I were really glad to give more locals the chance to show their talents,” she told Lowvelder. “We are working towards bringing music back into the lives of Nelspruiters and are very excited for what the future holds.” The crowd at The Pub were enthusiastic and the whole place was full to the brink in support of the musicians.
