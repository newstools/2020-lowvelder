 BARBERTON – The discovery of two bodies next to Lily Mine in Lows Creek on Friday has set in motion a murder investigation. The police discovered the bodies after being alerted by residents in the early hours of the morning. The bodies were identified as Sipho Nyambi and Bheki Phiri. Col Colin Mdluli, of the provincial police, said a preliminary investigation suggested the pair may have been stoned.
Mdluli could not confirm what the motive for the attack was and added that no arrests have been made, as the police continue their investigations.

Following the discovery on Friday, the Mpumalanga police conducted a raid on the mine on Saturday morning.
