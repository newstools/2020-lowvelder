MBOMBELA – Eskom announced on Tuesday that it will implement stage 2 load-shedding from 01:00 until 06:00 tomorrow morning. “In order to minimise the impact of
load-shedding on South Africans, (it) is scheduled during early morning hours to maximise electricity availability during the working day,” it announced in a statement. “Owing to a loss of additional generation capacity, emergency reserves had to be extensively utilised to supplement capacity during the day. “These now need to be replenished to meet tomorrow’s demand. The system
remains constrained and unpredictable with breakdowns sitting at 13 600MW. “In order to give matriculants an opportunity to receive their results, the
implementation of stage 2 load-shedding has been delayed to 01:00 on Wednesday. ALSO READ: Uplands maintains 100 per cent pass rate “This decision will also allow them enough time to make their way
