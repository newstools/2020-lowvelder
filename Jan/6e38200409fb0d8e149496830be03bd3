 WHITE RIVER – Its top achiever, Laila Abdallah, obtained a phenomenal average of 90,6 per cent and passed all her subjects with distinctions. Dawie Oberholzer, the principal at Rob Ferreira, noted the following of the 96-year-old institution of learning: “Here, ordinary children can become extraordinary, because we know every one of the 143 pupils who wrote their matric exams by name. The pass rate could have been better; the children who did not make it, all mainly failed their Afrikaans subject.” Other notable achievements are those of Amè Verster and Zantè Bensch, who attained a 82,7 per cent and 82,1 per cent average respectively.

Oberholzer stated that he wished the matrics all the best for the future, and that they should pursue their studies in all earnest.
