 Unleaded 95 octane petrol is expected to drop by eight cents a litre in February, but 93 octane petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin are all set for a price rise at month-end. The AA says 93 octane petrol is showing a one cent-a-litre rise, with 13 cents for both grades of diesel, and 10 cents for illuminating paraffin.

The association says political tensions in the Middle East, one of the world’s richest oil-producing regions, are likely to produce continued uncertainty which would feed into oil price movements. “The rand’s performance will be key in keeping any further oil hikes at bay,” it concludes.
