 The 56-year-old man, who cannot be named until he has pleaded to the charges, was charged with allegedly sexually assaulting eight grade seven learners, in the Tonga Magistrate’s Court last year. He was released on R2 000 bail. A statement issued by the school said the allegations came to light when a grade seven girl told the school’s trauma counsellor about an incident. Similar incidents then came to light. A school representative then laid a charge with the police.

The teacher was suspended by the Department of Education pending a departmental investigation and the outcome of the legal proceedings. The accused appeared in the Malalane Magistrate’s Court on last week Monday and requested the court to postpone the date as he appointed a new legal representative.
