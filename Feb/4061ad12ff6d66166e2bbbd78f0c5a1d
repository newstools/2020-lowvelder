 In a press release from Eskom, it is mentioned that “suspending load-shedding during the peak traffic hours is a pilot programme aimed at achieving an appropriate Load-shedding Philosophy for the country.” “As this is not possible every day, it will be confirmed each day, dependent on the risk based on the available capacity and emergency reserves on the day.” Eskom goes on to say that stage 2 load-shedding will be implemented until Thursday at 06:00, with respite during the early morning and evening traffic periods (06:00 – 09:00 and 16:00 – 18:00) when possible.
