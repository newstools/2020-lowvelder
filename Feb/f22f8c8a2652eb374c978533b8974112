 Kruger Park Management would like to advise guests driving inside the park to be on the look-out and avoid using the gravel roads until further notice. The high-intensity rain, especially in the north of the park should start clearing by tomorrow, February 12 but the rivers might continue to rise for some time. Reacting to the news, Reynold Thakhuli, SANParks Acting Head of Communications, said a decision has been taken to close most of the gravel roads in the park for safety reasons. He said, “As a precautionary measure gravel roads and remote camps mostly in the north of the park have temporarily been closed and guests booked in the flagged camps are being moved to safer camps. “These closures are necessary to ensure visitors’ safety during this time and we would like to advise guests to stick to the tar roads while driving inside the Park.” ALSO READ: Floods threaten due to constant rain The remote camps and gravel roads which are temporarily closed are as follows He advised guests to avoid all roads with No Entry signs or those that are blocked with other objects.
