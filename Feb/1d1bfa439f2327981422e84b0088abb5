 The new Valley Hyper Shopping Centre, opposite Valencia Wholesalers, is set to open on April 30.   With an approximate 16 700 square metres of leasable space, the new centreâ€™s biggest anchor tenant will be Checkers Hyper, which will occupy no less than a whopping 8 638 square metres. The Hyper is going to be a Checkers Fresh X-specification store and will have a similar look and feel to the Checkers Hypers in the Mall of Africa, Fourways Mall and Centurion Mall. A stand-alone Checkers Liquor store will be located at the entrance to the Hyper.  ALSO WATCH:Celebrate a traditional SA dish with a milk tart bake-off
