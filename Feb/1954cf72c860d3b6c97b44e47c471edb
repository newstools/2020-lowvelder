 The CANSA Relay For Life Mbombela’s Carnival of Hope event was launched at Emnotweni on Monday February 17. Moving videos of cancer survivors and CANSA research were played to give those present an idea of the work that goes on behind the scenes at CANSA. Christelle Strauss, Global Hero of Hope 2019/20, gave an inspirational message, reminding us to smile with her reference to the song that helped her through her journey.
