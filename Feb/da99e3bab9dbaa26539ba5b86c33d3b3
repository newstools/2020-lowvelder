 There were lots of big winners in 2019. In politics, Boris Johnson came up trumps (no pun intended). At the Oscars, Bohemian Rhapsody was the big winner. In motorsport, Lewis Hamilton reigned supreme. And, in the South African motor industry, the Volkswagen Tiguan was the big winner in the resale value stakes. According to Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price, this enterprising start-up has conducted the first-ever study into annual winners in the resale value stakes. “We decided to analyse which 2018 model year vehicles achieved the best resale value (measured against the original list price) during 2019.

True Price is able to produce this data because its team attends bank repossession auctions throughout the year in order to document the prices achieved. These values are used to provide motorists with free vehicle evaluations. The company has data pertaining to thousands of vehicle auctions on its system. Accordingly, it is able to provide high scientific and extremely accurate vehicle evaluations. It is this data that the True Price team examined in order to come up with the list of the top 10 resale value winners of the 2019 calendar year.  Volkswagen is the biggest winner, with three vehicles in the top 10. Toyota and Kia also perform admirably, with two vehicles in the top 10 each. Hyundai, Renault and Isuzu each have one vehicle on the list. This first-ever study into annual winners in the resale value stakes – that analyses 2018 models sold in 2019 – will be repeated at the end of 2020. “We will analyse all the 2019 models sold in 2020 and provide another top ten list at the beginning of 2021. So, watch this space!” concluded Jacobson. ALSO READ: SAAF celebrates 100 years in the air
