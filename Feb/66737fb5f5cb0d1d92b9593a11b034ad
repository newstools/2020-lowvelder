 Jan’s car lost its right front wheel right there on the parade lap. This after months and months of preparation and building the car. After a long absence in the midget class, Fielies was looking forward to showing Alex how real men drive those oval turns, but on route to the track, his bakkie’s engine retired. So, we will hopefully now see these guys in action at the next race meeting in March.

His mojo is mojo-ing again… And then another oudste, Chris Moolman, decided to grab more track time.  He showed that he had not lost his charm or touch behind the wheel of his yellow Datsun. And news just in is that Riaan Wolmerans is building a pram with mags and a Beetle engine with twin Weber. Guess who that is for?  And then there are some new rules this year (but then, there are new rules every year) – or is it a new application of a rule? Anyway, competitors line up in their predetermined positions in the pit lane – there is no stop-start. They drive a slow one-lapper and the COC will give them the green flag. Line up in the wrong position, and, well, the problem is yours.  I like this – it speeds up the racing process/order and makes for a more productive event. Can we now also speed up the watering of the track? I know you can’t, but eish! The next race meeting is on March 7 at 17:00. ALSO READ: Dam levels steadily climbing amid constant downpour
