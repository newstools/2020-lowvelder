 This included a decision on new club shirts and much more.  The first run of 2020 was to Ilane Game Farm on the Uitkyk road. Twelve vehicles, including two first-timers and a French couple in a Landy, participated in this event. The route proved challenging and technical, with every obstacle offering different approach options.  There was something for everyone, from the novice to the experienced, from the standard 4×4 to the modified.
The ladies were not intimidated, either. The day was concluded with a braai in the bush. Various prizes were presented. Transgressors received spot fines and the prized driver of the day trophy was awarded to Gerhard Pelser, driving a standard Ford Ranger.

It was his first time on an official run with the club. To tease your taste buds, here are some of the planned trips for 2020: • April 24-27 – Mozambique trip to Machubo Lodge
• August 29 – Mpumalanga Show
• September 24-27 – another faraway trip, a venue to be advised.  Not to mention the monthly club meetings, and a run at the end of every month.
