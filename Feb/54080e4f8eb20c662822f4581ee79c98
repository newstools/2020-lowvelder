 Eskom released a press statement this morning stating that despite some units having returned to service last night, load-shedding has been implemented to accommodate the shortage of capacity and to replenish emergency reserves. “Diesel reserves for open cycle gas turbines and water reserves, for the hydro-pumped storage schemes, were utilised extensively yesterday and overnight to supplement the shortage of capacity and are not at adequate levels to sustain the capacity shortage for today,” Eskom said. “As the system is vulnerable, any additional changes on the system performance may require a shift in stage at short notice. We will provide regular updates.” See the schedule below. 11:00-13:30
