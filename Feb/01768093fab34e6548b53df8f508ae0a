Laerskool Barberton is ready to host the NTT Barberton Interprimary at Hoërskool Barberton on Saturday, despite ongoing unrest in town. The school assured parents that the week-long protests will in no way hinder the proceedings. “Up to now, the protests were largely confined to Emjindini. We therefore strongly advise the public to use the second entrance to Barberton – Sheba Road,” said Laerskool Barberton’s Lynette Spencer.  Lowvelder will update, should the situation change.
