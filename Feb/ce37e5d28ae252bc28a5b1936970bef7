 Well-known Mbombela businessman, Paul Wood, is such a doer of things. Many years ago, while still involved with Mazda, he initiated the cleaning of green areas along our main routes through town. “It’s mostly a feel-good thing – for us and everyone else. I like things to be clean and organised,” he said. His irritation with potholes that are not being attended to has motivated him and his Heritage Motor Group team to now fix them themselves. This will, however, happen completely at random and ad hoc. “A bag of asphalt does not cost an arm and a leg – we buy it and we fix the hole – done,” said Paul. In my mind, each and every business and homeowner should take responsibility for their sidewalk. Even that of their neighbour, should he/she be unable to do so. So get organised, get active, get involved and soon your street or precinct may be recognised as being the most beautiful in town. Property values may well increase. Are you up for the challenge?
