 MBOMBELA – The local licencing offices had barely become operational when the system went offline again last week. Motorists are beyond frustrated, noting how day after day they arrive to renew their licences, only to be told the system is offline. Some are particularly upset that officials advised them to try the offices in White River, Barberton or Hazyview instead – and thus drive there with unlicensed vehicles. Moreover, Lowvelder is aware of situations where motorists are fined, upon finally being able to renew their licences, for late renewal – after having tried to get assistance for weeks.
