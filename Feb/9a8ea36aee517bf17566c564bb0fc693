 “The MEC was punctual, but there were disruptive elements that led to the MEC’s decision to cancel the meeting,” Mamba said. He added that there would be no school for all learners, reneging on an earlier statement in which he promised that learning would not be disrupted as the protests continued.  At a community meeting held at Zanini yesterday afternoon, Mamba addressed residents and asked that healthcare workers, including nurses and doctors, be allowed to continue working.

There will not be any burning of public facilities. We condemn that very strongly,” concluded Mamba. ALSO READ: Barberton protesters in no mood to give up
