Here the executive head of Curro Nelspruit, Mike Bownes, receives a Citroen C3 from Westvaal Nelspruit dealer principal Jannie Nell. “This is the third year that we have received a vehicle sponsorship from Westvaal. The C3, quite a luxurious little car, will, among others, serve as a backup vehicle to our school bus when transporting learners to various events,” said Bownes. “It is really wonderful to be able to synchronise with a local business in this manner.” “The C3 offers excellent ground clearance, 81kW on tap, a six-speed autobox and lots of luggage space. So we be believe it is the ultimate match for Curro’s application,” concluded Jannie. ALSO READ: Peugeot now available at Westvaal
