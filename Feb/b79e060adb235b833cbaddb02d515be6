Thus, after a ceremonial slow drive around the oval, the handing over by Palm Motors took place right in front of the main pavilion and amid loud cheer and excitement from learners, parents and staff alike. “This really is a wonderful occasion for us and the Crafter 35, bought from Palm Motors in White River, will serve us well. It also cements the wonderful and rewarding relationship we have with the guys from Palm Motors,” said principal Werner van Tonder. “We are delighted to partner with the community through the use of our products and our aftersales services. The Crafter has proved itself a workhorse within demanding transport environments and we have no doubt that Nelspruit Primary’s experience of this bus, will synchronise with this trend,” said Dirk.
