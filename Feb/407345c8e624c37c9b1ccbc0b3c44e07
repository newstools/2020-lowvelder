 The Lowveld Air Show committee reached a decision to postpone the 2020 Lowveld Air Show during a special meeting held earlier this month. “Since the 2017 air show, the committee has considered the option of only hosting an air show once every two years. We played with the idea, but continued hosting it each year due to public demand. The 2019 air show was one of our biggest and most successful air shows ever hosted. “The new approach of a shorter air show and other factors that contributed to it being such a great success, made this an incredibly hard decision to make,” Johan Heine, chairperson of the Lowveld Air Show committee stated. “We understand most of our valued partners, each year, look forward to being part of this very popular Lowveld family event.

Heine added that they are certainly committed and excited to get planning underway for a bigger and better Lowveld Air Show 2021. What are your best memories of the Lowveld Air Show?
