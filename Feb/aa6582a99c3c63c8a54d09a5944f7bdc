 MBOMBELA – According to Deon Visser, the school’s principal, Kegan had been absent for some time. The school previously phoned the family, concerned about his absenteeism. The Fenshams then informed the school that he had been complaining of stomach aches. Kegan was admitted to hospital on Friday, and passed away on Sunday afternoon. Visser mentioned that it is suspected that there had been an infection in one of his organs, although they are not really sure what caused his death. “Kegan was a soft-spoken young man and greatly loved by his teachers and friends. He loved his school and participated in hockey, chess and also the Mathematics Olympiad. Our thoughts and prayers are with the whole family,” Visser said. No details have been given regarding funeral arrangements. The family has requested time to process and mourn the tragedy, although his father sent the following message to Lowvelder, through Visser: “He was a young man whose aspirations and dreams went far beyond many people’s imaginations. He will be endlessly missed by everyone that had the privilege of knowing him.” ALSO READ: Sonpark Centre affected by hospital parking ban
