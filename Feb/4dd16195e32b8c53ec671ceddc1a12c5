This little Peugeot 108 will, for the next year, see service as an official staff vehicle and also as a backup to large sporting events. I say little, but in fact she is big on features, comes with a five-year service and maintenance warranty and can generally be considered hip and upcoming, and, of course, as French as they come. With 53kW on tap and a fuel consumption index of 4,1 litres/100km, it will not only starve the fuel stations, but be sparing on your wallet. “We are sincerely grateful for Westvaal’s involvement with our school and these annual sponsorships are a win-win for all involved,” said principal, Johan Hattingh.
