 MBOMBELA – “In 2019 the vehicle assisted more than 100 stranded motorists, gave support to vehicle-tracking companies and was responsible for 34 arrests. We thank our sponsors who helped make this possible,” said Callum
Mac Pherson, Hi-Tech operations manager. “Without the support of these organisations, the fight against crime in the Lowveld would be greatly weakened. The N4 patrol vehicle not only serves travellers on the N4 between Mbombela City and the Nkomazi Toll Plaza, but also strategically covers one of the most-used criminal escape routes out of our city. The vehicle also provides emergency support to those living along this route.”  Sponsors of the N4 patrol vehicle, a new Nissan NP200 bakkie, attended the launch of the new version in person and Hi-Tech expressed their gratitude for that.
