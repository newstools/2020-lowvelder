 The brand, James Sedgwick Distillery, showcased three of its whiskies, namely Bain’s Cape Mountain Whisky, Three Ships Whisky five-year-old and Three Ships Whisky 10-year-old Single Malt Vintage 2006. Guests were treated to a three-course meal, each paired with a select whisky. Andy Watts, whiskymaker, briefly discussed the history of the whisky before it was served. Watts told Lowvelder, “Tonight is all about exposing local music, good food and good local whisky.” He further explained, “Our whisky is made from the finest raw material, whether it be maize or barley.
Then it goes through the five stages of whisky-making, which are: malting, mashing, fermentation, distillation and maturation.” ALSO READ: Legendary Potluck Boskombuis closing its “doors” Last year the brand visited Pretoria, Cape Town, Johannesburg, East London and Durban, letting locals indulge in their whisky. “This year is our first visit is to Mbombela.
