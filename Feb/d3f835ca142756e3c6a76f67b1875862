 Domestic and irrigation water use restrictions are still in place in the Crocodile, Sabie Sand, White River, and Lomati catchments as per system operating rules. In the Crocodile catchment, restrictions are 20 per cent and 60 per cent restriction on domestic and irrigation respectively, Sabie Sand catchment restrictions are 10 per cent and 40 per cent restriction on domestic and irrigation, Lomati catchment restrictions have increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for domestic use, the White River catchment restriction is 65 per cent on irrigation use, and in the Lower Komati catchment, the restriction is 35 per cent on irrigation use on the areas supplied by Maguga and Driekoppies Dam. All efforts to improve the situation must be implemented by affected and responsible parties, and the restrictions are to remain in place until further notice. Irrigation boards and municipalities are still encouraged to ensure that these restrictions are adhered to by water users, while Inkomati-Usuthu Catchment Management Agency (IUCMA) continues to monitor usage and ensuring compliance and enforcement where necessary. The latest South African Water Services (SAWS) seasonal climate watch report for February to June indicates that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is currently in a borderline weak El Niño state and the forecast indicates that it will most likely remain at the border between the weak El Niño and neutral states for the rest of the summer season and early autumn. The rainfall forecast for early autumn (Feb-Mar-Apr) and mid autumn (Mar-Apr-May) from the SAWS/NOAA-GFDL Multi-Model system indicates enhanced probabilities of below-normal rainfall over most of the country, with the exception of the eastern parts during mid-autumn, which favours above-normal rainfall conditions.

as can be seen through the slight increases in water levels in our water resources and dams. While there has been some slight rainfall received across the Inkomati Usuthu WMA, there is a high probability that more severe restriction will be imposed in September.
