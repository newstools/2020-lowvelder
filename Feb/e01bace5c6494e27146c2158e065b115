The Department of Water and Sanitation would like to re-emphasize the importance of water conservation and remind the public that South Africa is a water-scarce and dry country which makes each and every drop more important for water security. The Department, therefore, encourages the public to be more conservative and use the available water more wisely and sparingly.
