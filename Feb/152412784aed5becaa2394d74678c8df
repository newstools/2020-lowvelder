 The newly launched Paytronix – School of Excellence was opened last September. Shortly after it donated six boxes of tech equipment each to two schools in underprivileged communities. Ernest Rangaka, the director of XLEducation, said their aim was to elevate the use of technology in schools. Ben Mabuza, director and executive of Paytronix told Lowvelder that in order to give back to the community, they decided to help less-fortunate communities by assisting the children. He formally handed over a scholarship to Sizwe Sbusiso Khubayi from Masitakhe Secondary School during a breakfast meeting at Ithuba’s offices on Tuesday January, 28. This covers all expenses, from tuition and study material, to accommodation, meals and a carefully considered allowance for daily needs such as toiletries. Sizwe has been accepted to study BCom accounting at Rhodes University. He is thrilled to have been given an opportunity to pursue his dreams and pledged to study hard. “I will do everything that is required of me to improve and do well. I will make sure I attend all my classes and make the library my first home, doing all relevant research to excel. And as time goes on, when I have spare time I will go and volunteer at orphanages and the likes,” Sizwe said.

It has instead been offered to another top performing learner of the same school. The scholarship programme does not require pupils to pay it back or do an internship for Paytronix after they have completed their degree. All that is required of them is to excel in their academics.
