The proven 2.5 turbodiesel engine delivering 75kW and 260Nm, drives the rear wheels via a five-speed manual transmission. A simplified two-colour line-up, comprising ivory white and quicksilver metallic, has been adopted. Another key differentiator between the new generation 14-seater Quantum and the reintroduced HiAce 14-seater, is the driver’s license requirement.
