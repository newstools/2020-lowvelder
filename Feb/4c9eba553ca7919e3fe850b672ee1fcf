 At this year’s Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA), Continental presented Conti C.A.R.E., a comprehensive technology system. These characteristics are also closely aligned with the requirements of electric and autonomous driving in both individual and shared mobility scenarios.  In combination with the web-based ContiConnect Live application, Conti C.A.R.E. forms a flexible system solution that provides a means of tyre management for modern robo-taxi fleets, for example, boosting performance as well as helping to optimise costs. Conti C.A.R.E. tyres feature sensors that are built into the structure of the tyre. These sensors generate and continuously evaluate data concerning tread depth, possible damage, tyre temperature and tyre pressure.

No less innovative is the idea of actively adjusting tyre pressures by means of centrifugal pumps built into the wheel. As the vehicle accelerates, the centrifugal forces within the wheel act on the pump to generate compressed air.  This PressureProof technology keeps the tyre pressure constantly within the ideal range and helps achieve a sustainable drop in CO2 emissions. Any excess compressed air is stored in an integrated tank. PressureBoost technology then uses this air to rapidly adapt the tyre pressures to various driving situations.
