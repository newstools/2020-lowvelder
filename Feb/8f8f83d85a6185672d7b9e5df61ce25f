The incidents stretched across Tonga, Matsulu, Pienaar, KaBokweni, as well as Barberton. “The SAPS greatly appreciates the excellent collaboration between the community and police members, along with the SAPS’ Crime Intelligence Unit, who tirelessly gathered information that led to the rearrest of the four suspects,” Brig Leonard Hlathi said. “When the police made a call on Monday February 3 regarding their escape, the media swiftly responded by publicising their photos. This in turn alerted the community, hence the positive results we all pride ourselves in.” ALSO READ: 11 injured in accident on Schoemanskloof Road The provincial commissioner of the police in Mpumalanga, Lt Gen Mondli Zuma, also congratulated all parties involved, and indicated that working as a collective can definitely assist in the fight against crime. “I am elated about the rearrest of the suspects as they were surely going to terrorise the community again.” “In the same breath, I want to pass words of gratitude to the committed and fearless community members as well as the astute media fraternity, with the aim of apprehending the suspects.
