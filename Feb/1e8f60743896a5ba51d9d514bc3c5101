 MBOMBELA – The learners at the Button Foundation were surprised recently when they received cheeseburgers and a juice from McDonalds, as part of a partnership between Lowvelder and the fast-food franchise. This foundation was chosen after a letter from one of the learner’s mothers was received. “My son Dillon is deaf and there are no schools that completely provide for this disability. It was with great excitement that I heard that Jaydre Button was reopening her centre. In class they all learn sign language and use this when games are played. I saw my child go from being distant to wanting to go to school and being excited about it,” Bianca Swanepoel said. The Button Foundation was established in 2008. “We recognised the need that parents have to educate their children, as most parents are working and struggle to set aside enough time for home education. A great part of these needs involves students who struggle to concentrate or suffer from some sort of condition that makes mainstream education difficult,” explained Jaydre Button, founder of the Button Foundation.
