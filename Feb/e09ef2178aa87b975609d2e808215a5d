 Schultz, who on weekends takes his camera to the bush to take pictures, had an interesting sighting when he went to an active lion sighting, but instead found “excited and playful baboons”. The site was said to be where lions and leopards hid their cubs. It was reported to Schultz that in the midst of the baboon troop, there might be a lion cub. After a long period of waiting he noticed a male baboon carrying a lion cub. “The baboon crossed the road and climbed a marula tree. We then noticed the lion cub was alive,” he said.

The baboon troop soon got used to the presence of the lion and excitedly started fighting over it. “The cub seemed exhausted, although uninjured to the naked eye,” Schultz noted.

He further explained, “It was already about 30 degrees by 8 am. Dehydration also seemed to be playing a part. The baboons started moving further in and I left the sighting as other vehicles arrived”. He doubted if the cub would survive after the internal injuries. However, if it survived, it may become a danger to the baboon troop.

We cannot get involved and we need to keep Kruger simple and wild,” he concluded. Photo: www.kurtsafari.com
