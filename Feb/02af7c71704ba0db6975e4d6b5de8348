 The South African Local Government Association (Salga) in Mpumalanga will be hosting the Municipal Governance and Finance Indaba in Secunda next month. SALGA has adopted a multi-disciplinary approach that aims to curb working in silos and enhance the effectiveness of a consolidated hands-on support programme to member municipalities. This multi-disciplinary approach is also extended to other stakeholders through the Integrated Municipal Support Plan partnerships in the province.

This support programme is based on a multidisciplinary approach focusing on institutional capacity, financial management, leadership and governance. This will assist in enhancing accountability, governance and service delivery that will result in improved municipal performance for these municipalities. The indaba will take place on March 5 and 6 at the Graceland Hotel Country Club in Secunda. ALSO READ: Illegal mining of stichtite still ongoing
