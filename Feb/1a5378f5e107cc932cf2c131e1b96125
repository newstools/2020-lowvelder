 BARBERTON – Fallen heroes were honoured at the annual Pro Patria Parade over the weekend at the Barberton Garden of Remembrance. A large contingent of the Moth Motorcycle Association of Gauteng also attended the parade. District Old Bill, JC Coetzee led the proceedings under a tent rigged for the visitors, as the rain bucketed down.

Organised by the Lowveld District Dugout, this parade is held every year on the second Saturday of February to honour those who died in the Border War, but also the fallen soldiers involved in all wars. “The MOTHs organise these parades for any and all who fought in wars and lost their lives. We would like to encourage the community to attend and support these events, so that we can stand together,” said Glenn du Preez, Wee Bill of the Lone Tree Shellhole.
