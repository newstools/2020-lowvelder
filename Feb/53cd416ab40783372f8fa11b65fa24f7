 MBOMBELA – The provincial commissioner of police in Mpumalanga, Lt Gen Mondli Zuma, was greatly pleased when four suspects were sentenced today. The men who escaped from lawful custody at Pienaar Police Station last week, were handed a 36-month jail term each. They went into hiding for six days before they were rearrested in Skhwahlane Village near Tonga. “The media, community, as well as the police worked together to ensure that the criminals were brought to book again,” Brig Leonard Hlathi said in a press release. “This concerted effort paid off and they were sniffed out of their hiding places.” ALSO READ: Reading culture should be a lifestyle All four men appeared today and were sentenced immediately. Zuma indicated that when the police work closely with the community, criminals’ activity will be limited and monitored effectively, as “freedom cannot be shared with lawbreakers”. He also expressed his appreciation for the swift action by the court in sentencing the escapees immediately. “As the police in Mpumalanga, we are delighted by the swift response by the court in sentencing the men. This is surely a warning to other suspects that escaping from lawful custody is regarded as a serious crime and is punishable by law, ” said Zuma. The convicts are expected to appear in the same court on April 17, facing their initial 32 charges of house burglaries and murder. ALSO READ: Beads string together the lives of rural women
