 Gazebo Funk Club, in short, is an initiative to teach people to see reading as a lifestyle and not an event. Jim Savvy and his team visit various schools and libraries to discuss the importance of reading, and help people to read by sharing story booklets. A conversation is held every Wednesday at the public library in Mbombela, where people get the opportunity to share their stories. These are then put together and used to write an anthology.
