Learners of the tutoring centre, Passion with a Purpose, were in for a treat when McDonald’s Nelspruit surprised them with a burger bust on Tuesday.  One of the children’s mother, Marjolein da Costa did not want this hard-working centre to go unnoticed, so she nominated them to receive a surprise bust of cheeseburgers and juice. They all enjoyed the well-deserved treat. MBOMBELA – Every week one lucky class of kids is busted with McDonald’s as part of a partnership between Lowvelder and McDonalds.Last week February 7, the grade 12A class of Valencia Combined School was busted. Monique de Wit, the class 12A register teacher, contacted Lowvelder to request that they get the McDonald’s to treat.“It is an honour for me to work with such dedicated kids.  Everyone comes from different homes with different backgrounds but at school, they are a team. They work together and help to build each other up,” Each child was given a McDonald’s cheeseburger and a juice, which they enjoyed in class.“I’m proud of my class. I will do anything to treat them a little and to motivate them for the year ahead,” de Wit concluded. The class enjoyed the treat and de Wit had tears in her eyes from seeing her class so happy.
