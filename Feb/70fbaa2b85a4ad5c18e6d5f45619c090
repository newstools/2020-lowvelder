 Edumatics’ recent education expo offered different schools the opportunity to market themselves to the public from last Friday  to Sunday. Organiser Sheldene Sander-Smit told Lowvelder that experts showcased and displayed what their schools had to offer. Curro represented its three schools: Curro Nelspruit, Meridian Karino and Curro Academy Mbombela. Amanda Steven-Jennings, a representative of the school, said they are more than just an independent school and cater for children of all ages. “We are a one-stop shop.

We are still accommodating learners who have not been placed.” Annemarie Kleynhans, principal of Destiny College, said they were situated in a different environment. “We are in a former holiday resort. It is farm-like, and this natural experience has an effect on the learners. We are a boarding school with only 10 day scholars. We are family-oriented and pay attention to each child.” The King’s School principal, Marick Coetzee, said their learners use Edu-pads for textbooks, lessons and PowerPoints. “This assists learners to catch up at any time. We cater for pupils from preschool to grade 12. We have hostels and offer holiday and Saturday schools. We make use of all opportunities to educate our learners”.
