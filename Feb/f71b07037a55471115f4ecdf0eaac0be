Go and arrest those who have been looting and conducting themselves in a criminal way,” he said.

Mkhonto added that protest action would intensify until their demands were met. “The struggle will continue until the deputy president, David Mabuza, addresses our concerns. The cadres he has deployed have not done anything to resolve the issues we are faced with,” he concluded.
