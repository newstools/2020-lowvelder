 Barberton – Up to now, the protests were largely confined to Emjindini, with barricades set up in Extensions 10, – 11, Dindela and Phumula.  Reports emerged this morning that a group of protesters were seen in Burgerville, setting up barricades and setting fires in the streets.  One protester said, “This is our strategy to unite Barberton as we call for a break from the City of Mbombela.”  This is in the aftermath of unsuccessful talks with Mbombela mayor Sibusiso Mathonsi on Friday. Protesters have vowed to intensify protest action if their demand to be” divorced” from Mbombela is not met, citing poor service delivery, job scarcities and the recent water cuts.  Police have deployed the “amabherete” tactical response team in response to the protests. Protesting residents are playing a game of cat-and-mouse with the team, operating under cover of darkness and barricading streets at night.  Read more in Tuesday’s Lowvelder.
