 MBOMBELA – The market, arranged by Rika Venter-Coley from Events Africa, is currently three years old and first started out at the Blue Gate Tea Garden in Ehmke Street. In July 2019, the market moved to Nadine’s, a tea garden at the old Nelspruit Airfield. “As part of the market, we work together with local businesses to get them extra exposure, and this in turn creates an opportunity for the local suppliers to get better rates on their stall fees,” said Venter-Coley.
