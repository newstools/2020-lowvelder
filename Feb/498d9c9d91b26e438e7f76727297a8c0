 Different parts of the KNP, specifically the far north, received heavy rain that forced the Kruger Park management to temporarily close all the gravel roads and remote camps. Helicopters flew to flagged camps to move guests to safer camps. Reynold Thakhuli, SANParks’ acting head of communications, commented, “These closures are necessary to ensure visitors’ safety during this time and we would like to advise guests to stick to tar roads while driving inside the park.” ALSO READ: Latest load-shedding schedule Els-Katrien Vantieghem, a guest at Nyalaland Wilderness Trail Camp, said, “It was an exciting time. I never thought they would fly from Skukuza to us, but they did.” She thanked the two SANParks helicopter pilots that evacuated them. Park management advised guests to avoid all roads with “No Entry” signs or those that are blocked with other objects. By Thursday morning the water levels had reduced. “Both the Letaba and Olifants are still running nicely today, but the levels have dropped,” said Dalene Preston, social media administrator, KNP. “Many of the smaller rivers have stopped running, or are at just a trickle.Interestingly, as soon as the rainfall in the catchment areas stops, the rivers slow down quickly. The N’waswitsontso is still running strongly. This river runs past Tshokwane, into Orpen Dam and out into Mozambique.” ALSO READ: Floods threaten due to constant rain No injuries or extreme damage have been reported.
