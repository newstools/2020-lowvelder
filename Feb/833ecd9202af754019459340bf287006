 SABIE – It is engineered to be interactive. Visitors are able to turn numerous blocks suspended on a column built into the platform, choosing picture icons and words to make a range of messages such as “She said yes” and “We love Sabie Panorama Route” to be included in their photos. The large wooden frame is discreetly tucked away from the mainstream pathways and stands close to one side of the breathtaking Lone Creek Falls, offering visitors to this beautiful region a perfect vantage point from which to take photos of the stunning waterfall with friends and family. The intentionally authentic wooden photo frame was the brainchild of the Sabie LTO committee members.”Digital technology has profoundly changed the way in which tourists interact with destinations and with each other, and it was time for Sabie to create an opportunity that our modern-day travellers would want to share on ever-popular social media platforms,” said Heather Berry of the Sabie LTO.
