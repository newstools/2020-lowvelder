 SAPS members of Nkomazi allegedly solicited bribes from citizens of Mozambique who were travelling on the N4 last week. According to reports, a team of dedicated police officials was dispatched to the Nkomazi area to investigate corrupt activities that have been going on for some time. There were complaints by the taxi industry that some police officers forced them to pay R100 per undocumented person found in their vehicles, for them to pass through. When team members carried out their probe, they spotted a police vehicle ferrying foreign nationals, who were later released upon payment of a certain fee. The police officials then set their eyes on the officers in question, and when these realised they were followed, they drove off at a high speed. These officers later abandoned the state vehicle and ran into the bush.

The officer was immediately arrested.
Sgt France Mathabela appeared in the Low’s Creek Magistrate’s Court last week on allegations of corruption and was granted bail of R1 000. He is expected to appear in the same court on April 16. “We welcome the arrest of people who use our uniform for personal gain and we hope the law will take its course and make an example of these officers. I also order the team to prioritise its investigation and arrest the remaining suspects,” said Lt Gen Zuma.  ALSO READ: Fire will not stop Dis-Chem from helping customers
