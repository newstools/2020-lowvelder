 Friends, families, athletes and models ran designated routes for different reasons. Nicole Merryweather decided to run in honour of her dad, who died of cancer in 2015. “It was a fun run and I enjoyed the route,” she said. “It was really a good run, but is was hot! I ran for the fun of it, and because of the donation towards CANSA,” Constance Ndlovu commented. Shereen Moorad, Terry Pillai and Elli Hajari all agreed. “The atmosphere was nice. We met friendly and encouraging people along the route. We will be back next year to support this, and we hope more people will join.” Ntateko Mafemani said, “This was tough, but fine. I will come back again.” Landa Mogale, a young model, commented, “My modelling agency encourages us to support such organisations. It was a fun run.” John Duncan, Joshua Vincent, Edric Mnisi and Jean Erasmus were the first four runners to finish. A free boot camp session was held after the fun run. Jacob van Rhyn, boot camp assistant, commented: “The boot camp is part of the fun run. It is for the people to stretch their body’s limits and exercise for their body weight.” Also read: Pilgrim’s Rest is where the heart is All the funds raised at the run will be donated to CANSA.
