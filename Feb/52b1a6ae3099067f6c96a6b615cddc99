 Two brothers who defrauded the taxman by submitting false tax claims will be spending the next 10 years behind bars. The arrest in 2009 followed an investigation by the Hawks where it was established that the siblings stole more than R1,5 million from the South African Revenue Services (SARS) by submitting false tax claims. They were facing 33 charges of fraud and money laundering. They were sentenced to 10 years’ direct imprisonment. At the time of their arrest the two were the owners of a construction company.

Gen Zodwa Mokoena, provincial head of the Hawks in Mpumalanga, said she was happy about the hefty sentence. “We are encouraged that, even after such a long time, the efforts of the investigation team and judiciary made sure the two brothers have been punished for their criminal activities. “We hope this sentence will send a message to would-be fraudsters that the long arm of the law will eventually catch up with them.” ALSO READ: Fire will not stop Dis-Chem from helping customers
