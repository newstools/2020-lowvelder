 March 6 will mark the last day you will able to dig into the epitome of authenticity that is Potluck Boskombuis.  The restaurant is known for its wood-fire cooked authentic South African dishes, the view from the windowless restrooms and sand hugging and comforting your feet, all under the African sky.  Situated on the banks of the Treur River and wrapped in the smells; of boerewors, pap and sheba, and steak cooked on the open fire; that fill the air, accompanied by an ice cold beer nestled between heaps of ice, this Lowveld gem will certainly be missed by many.  “It is with regret that we announce the closure of the legendary Potluck Boskombuis. The reason is beyond our control. We wish to thank our many regular customers for their support over the years,” said Francois and Mareli Laubscher. This is a developing story, and more information will be published as soon as it becomes available. Also read: Pilgrim’s Rest is where the heart is   > Photos by Stefan de Villiers
