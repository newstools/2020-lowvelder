 Students from the University of Mpumalanga’s (UMP) Mbombela Campus boycotted classes this week , claiming they had not been paid their allowances, among other issues. On Wednesday nothing moved in and out of the campus, as the gates were barricaded with tools, concrete bins, bricks and other materials.

Dr Paul Maminza, dean of student affairs, confirmed the university’s engagements with the SRC. He said issues raised by the council include remarking of scripts, the alleged academic exclusion of five students who were expelled after disciplinary hearings last year, and payment of NSFAS allowances.
“We had a very positive engagement with the student council on Tuesday. We were surprised when gates were closed on Wednesday. We are still engaging them with the hope that they will come to their senses to see how this is delaying academic progress,” he said.
