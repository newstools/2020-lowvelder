 MBOMBELA – For the past seven years, Church Unlimited has hosted Friday Night Live every Friday during school terms to accommodate primary school children, teenagers and their families.  “Friday Night Live is a safe option for teenagers on Friday nights with quality entertainment. There are plenty of activities available which can be enjoyed under adult supervision,” said Shaun Adams, one of the pastors and a big driving force behind the event.  Activities include playing pool, indoor soccer and video games. Meals and coffee are also available. “These events are for everyone, we welcome the community with open arms. We’ve also had some visitors from out of town a couple of times,” Adams mentioned.  The evenings also include motivational talks and life lessons that teenagers can apply to their everyday life.  A praise and worship session usually precedes the talks. The venue opens at 18:00 for anyone who wishes to join, with the talks for the teens starting at around 19:00. The community is advised to keep an eye on Church Unlimited’s Instagram for any special events. ALSO READ: Local companies support the Hi-Tech Security N4 Patrol vehicle project
