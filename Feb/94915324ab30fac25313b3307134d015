 Aiming to offer an experience that lets customers relax and be themselves and deepens the bond between car and owner, the model offers a creative time and space that invites new ways of using a vehicle. Under the Car-as-Art ethos, the styling of MX-30 aims to raise its artistic value and expand the expressive range of Mazda’s Kodo-Soul of Motion design language.  Based on a concept of “Human Modern”, the design stays grounded in the beautifully honed, handcrafted forms of Kodo, yet aligns itself with changing values and new lifestyles. Spaces in and around the centre console give the cabin an open feel, and environmentally conscious materials such as cork and fabrics made from recycled materials are used in ways that bring out their natural appeal, creating a comfortable interior space.

In line with the human-centric philosophy, Mazda engineers were determined to deliver the same Jinba-ittai driving joy that every Mazda offers in the EV as well.  The model adopts Mazda’s new electric-drive technology, e-Skyactiv, and combines outstanding response with smooth dynamic behaviour to achieve performance that drivers can enjoy naturally. Plans to launch to the Southern Africa market are still to be confirmed. ALSO READ: Floods threaten due to constant rain
