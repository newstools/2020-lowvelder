 An alleged serial rapist, who used a similar modus operandi in at least two cases, will appear before the Kabokweni court for an extended bail application next week. He appeared in court on January 22 for bail application, but investigating officer, Sgt Nthombi Mukgadi, vehemently fought the application. He said the police believe they have a strong case against the man.

He would then claim that he had spotted the girl and that he wanted to enter her for a modelling competition. He then allegedly lured his teenage victims to either a guest house or a nearby location where he raped them. The mother of one of the victims told Lowvelder that her daughter had been doing matric in a private school last year, but that she was so traumatised after the attack that she could not finish her final exams. “My daughter is going through hell. This man also stole her new phone, and now he phones us all the time, threatening my daughter to not tell anyone what happened or he will hurt her even worse.” The mother added that she could not understand how the court granted this man bail after the first incident. “He just keeps appearing in court, but nothing happens!” She said the rape did not leave only physical and emotional damage, but that as a single mother, she did not budget to put her child through matric a second time.

The case was postponed to February 6.
