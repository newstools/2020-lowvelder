 Each December, residents decorate their homes with lights and invite the public to come and view it. Van der Merwe created her Christmas garden with handcrafted decorations. “I decorated the garden with flowerpots, nutcrackers, gnomes, fairy lights, Father Christmases, a snowman, a melted snowman, angels, reindeer, giant cupcakes and giant lollipops,” she explained. For her effort she was rewarded with a gift voucher worth R5 000 from BUCO Nelspruit, at the prize-giving on Thursday morning at the estate. The other winners each received a R1 000 gift voucher, courtesy of AC/DC. Maria Cillers was the street winner, Philip Snyman the best newcomer and Dawie Pretorius was named the most enthusiastic resident.
