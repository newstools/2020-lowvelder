There are growing concerns about climate change and questions about whether the world will ever achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030, as established by the United Nations. As corporate citizens, Sappi Southern Africa has focused our operations on achieving a balance between people, planet and prosperity. Through stronger connections between these three pillars, we strive to create shared value through our operations, which will see all prosper. Against this backdrop, we have changed the name of our annual publication covering our sustainability work from the Sappi SA Sustainability Report to the Sappi SA Corporate Citizenship Report. Sappi SA is aligned with the United Nations SDGs as the blueprint for corporate citizenship and a way to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. While our integrated approach to responsible corporate citizenship ensures our actions underpin all 17 SDGs, we have identified nine priority goals. These include curbing poverty and focusing on quality education, clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production, climate action and life on land, as well as partnerships for these goals.
