 BARBERTON – After weeks of protests in Barberton, the situation reached boiling point at the town hall last week Thursday. Protesters marched to the Barberton Town Hall to attend a meeting with Cogta MEC, Mandla Msibi when a group, believed to be against the prolonged strike, ordered residents out of the hall. In a matter of minutes, the situation became volatile and soon afterwards, fists flew and bricks were hurled at the group. Njabulo Shugulugu Mkhonto leading protesters to the town hall.

The town came to a standstill as the Public Order Policing unit tried to restore calm and set off stun grenades in an attempt to restore order. This comes after a group disrupted the previous day’s planned meeting with protesters, Msibi and mining houses from the area at Mbombela Municipality. Violent scenes soon unfolded in the town.

In a video doing the rounds on Facebook, Mamba urged everyone to join the strike, which ostensibly calls for the separation of the Umjindi Local Municipality from the City of Mbombela Local Municipality. His call included all schools within Barberton, including Laerskool Barberton and Hoërskool Barberton. Schools were closed on Thursday and Friday as the protest action continued, with learners expected back at school yesterday. Mandla Mamba in discussion with the police.
