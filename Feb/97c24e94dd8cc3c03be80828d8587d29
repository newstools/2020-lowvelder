An update on the prognosis for the week is expected tomorrow evening. “Our teams are working hard to reduce unplanned outages or breakdowns. Critical maintenance continues to be conducted on units that are currently on planned outages,” Eskom said. Eskom further warned that any additional shifts on the system may require a change in the load-shedding stage. “We therefore request customers to use electricity sparingly and to reduce demand during this period. We also wish to remind South Africans that there is a possibility of load-shedding during the next 18 months, as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health.” ALSO READ: Pienaar SAPS escapees rearrested See the latest schedule below: 01:00 – 03:30
