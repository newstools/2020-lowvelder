SPAR Lowveld has once again made a donation to GRIP. On Monday it handed over R100 575 to the organisation. Together with the community, SPAR raised the funds during August from the sale of bracelets at all stores in the region. This was part of a national campaign to raise awareness and support the fight against gender-based violence during Women’s Month.

SPAR Lowveld helped us realise that there is still hope.” Kenyon said she will forever be grateful for what it does. “SPAR Lowveld truly shows that it cares about women and children. It is always behind GRIP and supports us,” she explained. Lowvelder had previously reported how the organisation’s funds had allegedly been mismanaged by some former members of the management team.
