The wish lists we received were fulfilled, which is jaw-dropping,” Joubert said. “The legends also held a rugby clinic in Ngodwana, and Sappi was one of the main sponsors of the event.” She added that many rugby legends came out on Saturday to help pack the trucks for the homes needing donations. “Ian Macintosh, Wynand Olivier, Jacques Potgieter, Marc Watson, Ryan Kankowski, Piet Joubert, Dick Muir, John Allan, and many more were there to help.
