Gates will open at 18:00 and the show starts at 19:00. “Bossies is a community project, a non-profit organisation that is dependent on the support of the community,” said Albert Gryvenstein, general manager of BCJ. As all organisations, it also took a big financial hit due to the Covid-19 pandemic and therefore a fundraising event was needed. “Jo Black is familiar with Bossies and he agreed to do his first show after lockdown,” Gryvenstein said.

Whether it’s R10 or R200, any amount will be beneficial to BCJ.” Tickets cost R180 per person, or companies can book tables for R2 000. Tickets are available at Marlin’s Pub and Grill, Mustangs, Radio Laeveld or phone Nicole Marais on 062-446-6411.
