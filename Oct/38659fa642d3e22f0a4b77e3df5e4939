October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month and aims to educate communities about the disease. Early detection is vital as it can ensure effective treatment and a positive prognosis. “Approximately 90 per cent of patients survive for many years after diagnosis when breast cancer is detected at the early stages,” stated the South African government website. CANSA Lowveld hosts many awareness events and initiatives, and the Shades of Pink Breast Cancer Awareness and Screening event will take place on October 30 at the Crossing Centre from 08:00 to 16:00. It offers women the opportunity to get free clinical examinations to check for any signs of breast cancer. For more information, contact Monique or Ramphosi at the CANSA Lowveld centre on 013-741-5441. This event is made possible through the help of Pinky Phosa Solutions Foundation and Crossing Centre Mbombela. ALSO READ: Support Sunflower Day in Mbombela and help save lives
