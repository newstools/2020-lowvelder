The two branches had run a promotion starting towards the end of August where customers were encouraged to bring cans of tinned food in order to receive a 10 per cent discount from in-store purchases. “We chose to donate the food to Betty’s Haven because of the amazing work they do,” said Cash Converters Nelspruit’s Dean Holder. “The orphanage experienced a fire in 2018 from which they are still trying to recover so we wanted to help where we could,” he said.
