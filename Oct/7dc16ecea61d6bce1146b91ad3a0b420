SANParks announced the arrest of three staff members on October 20. According to Ike Phaahla, GM: communications and marketing, Kruger National Park, two of the officials were employed as security guards and one was attached to technical services at one of the rest camps. The three were likely to have appeared in court on Thursday October 22 and will thereafter be subjected to internal employee disciplinary procedures. The arrest of the suspects followed after the law enforcement officials chased after their car, in which a fresh set of rhino horns was found.

While they may succeed in the short term, history shows that they will eventually be caught and this will be at the expense of their employment, the well-being of their families and community.” Between July and September, the anti-poaching teams arrested 16 suspected poachers inside the park and confiscated seven rifles. The teams also observed and followed-up on 410 poaching activities, sightings, spoors and camps in the past three months. “SANParks remains committed to doing everything in its power to stop poaching and to help secure the future of fauna and flora for sustainable use and for the benefit of future generations. We also take this opportunity to encourage members of the public and employees to report wildlife criminal activities on 013-735-0197 or 076-801-9679,” concluded Coleman. Investigations are ongoing.
