U.S. restrictions look to be biting at Huawei, with revenue growth slowing from the double-digit pace seen in previous quarters. Overseas sales have been sluggish, partly due to restrictions on Huawei’s use of Google apps. Huawei will soon stop making its high-end Kirin chips as US restrictions on supplying the firm take effect. International pressure on Huawei also seems to be growing. This week Sweden became the latest country to ban use of the company’s gear in its 5G networks. Despite everything, Huawei is still turning out new products. Late Thursday, the Chinese firm launched its latest flagship handset, the Mate 40 Pro.
