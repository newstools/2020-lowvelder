Roadworks are expected to be complete by mid-December. Road users are advised that traffic flow will be affected during the project, with traffic accommodation procedures including a daytime stop-and-go of two kilometres. This may result in delays and road users are urged to be patient and plan their trips accordingly. “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation at construction zones along the route and assure you of our continued commitment to keeping the N4 Toll Route in an excellent condition.”
