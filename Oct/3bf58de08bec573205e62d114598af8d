A well-known attorney from a firm in Mbombela died on Monday morning after being attacked and shot in the Plaston area. Gerrit Stander (38), an attorney of Swanepoel & Partners, was overpowered by a group of men around 02:00. According to his father, Martiens, who stays on the same property, the suspects allegedly cut the electric fence and broke down the security door and front door to gain access to the house. “The dog which was in the house at the time, started barking which woke Gerrit up. Upon arrival in the dining area, a scuffle ensued and he was shot three times. His wife, Yolandi, had sent out a cry for help on the area’s WhatsApp group, to which I responded,” Martiens said. Upon his arrival he discovered his son on the floor.
