MBOMBELA – The continuous uncertainty as a result of the extension of the Covid-19 state of disaster and the limitations on the hosting of big events left the board of Innibos and its name sponsor, Standard Bank, with no other choice – they had to cancel the 2020 event. Andy Lubbe, Innibos festival manager, said it is a sad, but a realistic decision. “We were ready to continue despite all the challenges. But in the end the risk is just too big, and we had to end the uncertainty. We owed that to all our partners.” Lubbe said the Covid-19 pandemic posed unprecedented and far-reaching challenges for arts festivals.

Last year Innibos contributed R82 million to the local economy. We may be somewhat despondent at the moment, but we definitely have not given up hope and we are already planning for next year.” The provisional date for 2021 is June 30 to July 4.
