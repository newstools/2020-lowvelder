SPAR awarded their loyal Lowveld customers with an exciting SHOP, SAVE & WIN campaign between June 26 to October 4, with an opportunity to win a share of R150 000 in SPAR vouchers to help during these trying times. The lucky winners are Nowell Spider and Casey Schaefer! Spider won a R10 000 SPAR shopping voucher and Casey, a friend of his for the last seven years, a R5 000 SPAR voucher. During the 15 week period – they randomly drew ten weekly winners from all entries in-store and online, who each received a R1 000 voucher and a Red ticket. These winners where they given an opportunity to post a selfie, taken in front of their favourite SPAR store, with their Red Ticket in hand, and post it on the SPAR Lowveld Facebook page. All Red ticket entries received stood a chance to be randomly selected as the beneficiary of a R10 000 SPAR voucher and an extra R5 000 SPAR voucher for a nominated friend. The eventual winner was Spider. ALSO READ: Save the date for Pro-Life’s 9th birthday bash  “I was quite surprised when I was informed about being the winner. I shop at SPAR Courtside just about every day of my life and well, to now be able to buy so much groceries and at my favourite SPAR is just wonderful. I nominated Casey because she has helped me on many occasions and now I can return the favour,” said Spider. “I was equally surprised – first thinking this was a joke,” said Schaefer. “I am truly grateful for this gift.” For SPAR Courtside manager, Géran Jansen van Rensburg, being of service to the community is “fundamental to our success and having the winner (and regular customer) from your shop is very rewarding”.
