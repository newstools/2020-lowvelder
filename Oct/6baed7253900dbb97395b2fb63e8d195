“I was blessed that this event was as successful as it was,” said organiser, Khatija Khan. “The intention was to boost the morale of the people that all hope is not lost; we can still stand together and fight this pandemic by helping others. It’s in giving that we receive.” Khan continued by mentioning that the market was held to uplift home-based businesses and to help established ones to grow.  “Many of these businesses suffered losses during lockdown,” she said. “It was great to see people out and about and just happy to meet friends and family whom they never got to see due to the restrictions.” The community of Mbombela and surrounding areas supported the market while still maintaining social distancing. With a variety of stalls selling goods such as food, homewares, cosmetics and clothing, there was a little of something for everyone. “This was just one of the many still to be held,” said Khan. “Look out for the posters and book a stall for the next market on December 5,” she added.
