PCA delivered the three tonnes of food and medical donations to the Free State on Monday. “It is our small way of showing these farmers that they are not alone or forgotten,” Hattingh said. “PCA will, without exception, respond to any disaster we are asked to assist with, regardless of the type and cause thereof. We salute these brave farmers and we will do our bit to make their lives a bit easier so they can concentrate on getting back on their feet and buy feed for their remaining animals,” he said.
