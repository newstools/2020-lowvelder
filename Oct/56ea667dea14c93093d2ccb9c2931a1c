With multiple stands offering a variety of food, snacks, little crafts and condiments, as well as a jumping castle, and of course, a beer tent, scores of people made their way to the festival, enjoying being out in the warm, sunny weather. The festival also hosted a few musicians, adding to the family-friendly environment with some live music. People sat in groups at the tables under the tent in the middle of the centre, enjoying drinks, good food and laughter.
