LYDENBURG –  A tipper truck, carrying hot tar, which gained too much momentum on the downhill, crashed down the embankment when the driver lost control. The truck broke through the barrier and overturned on the steep edge next to the road.  The truck lost its messy load and the seriously injured driver had to be freed from the cab by emergency workers from Lydenburg. The fairly new vehicle was completely destroyed by the impact.  The pass was temporarily closed later that afternoon to allow Van Wettens to recover the wreckage. ALSO READ: TRACN4 National Rally races into Dullstroom
