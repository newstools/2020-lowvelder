This unisex hair salon will cater to all your hair-related needs with the many services and products it has on offer.  There is also a nail technician based in the salon for those who want to make it an all-inclusive beauty experience. Owner, Monique Viljoen explains the meaning behind their chosen name.  “Cabelo means hair in Portugese, and it was just something a little different than your standard ‘Hair Studio.”  Just walking into the salon you can see that it is a cut above the rest. “Melissa and I really go the extra mile for our clients. One thing I can tell you is that they always come back for more. “We use some of the best products and not a month goes by that we do not have specials.  Not only do we give you 20 per cent off each Thursday, but every new client will get a 25 per cent discount on their first visit.” Between Melissa Rossouw and herself, they have 14 years’ worth of experience in the haircare business. The duo shares many before and after transformations on social media that reflect their craft.  • Colour • Highlights • Ombre • Balayage • Brazilian blow wave • Kiddies’ cuts • Perms • Relaxers • Extensions • Nails • Make-up.
