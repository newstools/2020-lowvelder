The organisation is inviting prospective legal firms with jurisdiction in the City of Mbombela districts to bid for this GBV programme. GRIP is an NPO providing care and support services to survivors of GBV and people living with HIV/Aids. The organisation’s founder, Barbara Kenyon said the remuneration will be determined by the client’s monthly service delivery. The key responsibilities of the legal firm which will meet the requirements are to observe the trial/legal proceedings services by GRIP in support of the survivors of GBV and report to the organisation on a monthly basis on the progress made on each case; to determine that the criminal law has dealt with cases effectively and ensure justice is served for the survivors and finalised; to comprehensively inform survivors on legal proceedings and what is expected from each survivor; to track all the GRIP GBV cases and report on the progress of each one in court on a monthly basis; to provide an advisory role to survivors, where possible, to influence acceleration of court cases where there are delays or backlogs dating as far back as July 1, 2019; and to partner with GRIP in conducting awareness campaigns to provide legal guidance on addressing the scourge. Kenyon said the requirements are that the legal firm must be based in the City of Mbombela, have the capacity and resources to report to the organisation on a monthly basis, three recommendation letters from past or current clients, and a company profile.  “Legal firms which meet the requirements should submit the required documentation under reference GBV/Legal/AFSA 2020 no later than October 20 either by email to info@grip.org.za, or by hand to the GRIP offices at Simunye Corner, 46 Anderson Street, Mbombela.” ALSO READ: Victim fights off attempted hijacker  Kenyon added that GRIP reserves the right not to make an appointment and should a legal firm not have received feedback within 30 days of the closing date, its application may be considered unsuccessful.
