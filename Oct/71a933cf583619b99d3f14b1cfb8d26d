One of the guards remained in the vehicle while the second guard entered the centre to collect a cash bin from Shoprite inside the centre. After he collected the cash, he was on his way back to the vehicle when he was approached by two suspects, one pointing a handgun at him. The two took the bin with the money, as well as the guard’s sidearm. The two suspects then ran to a vehicle parked close by. On their way to the getaway vehicle, the dye pack inside the money bin that was used by G4S activated, rendering the cash useless to the robbers. A dye pack is a radio-controlled incendiary device used by banks to foil a bank robbery.  It explodes and permanently marks the cash with dye shortly after a robbery. According to a source that does not want to be named, the amount stolen was in the region of R50 000. According to Shaun Terblanche of J&M Security, he received a phone call informing him that the robbery was in progress. “We immediately rushed to the scene and obtained CCTV footage to determine the make and model of the vehicle used in the robbery.  Looking at the CCTV footage, we determined that there were two suspects that used a light blue Toyota Corolla with black rims and an MP registration number. They fled on the R40 Hazyview/Masoyi road. “We also saw on the CCTV footage that they put a red triangle behind the getaway vehicle to create the impression that the vehicle had broken down,” Terblanche said.
