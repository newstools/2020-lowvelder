“The grade-seven market day is an annual event tied in with the curriculum and a way our scholars get to explore entrepreneurship and practical skills,” Reed said. “Our grade-seven scholars explored 21st-century skills like design, advertising, marketing, sales, distribution, production, accounting and business strategies as they set up their online shops for orders.” Once all orders were placed in the week leading up to the event, the fun market day took place at Penryn Prep on Monday 19 October. “Our scholars did a sterling job. A first-of-a-kind online ordering system was also used and the market was a huge success!” said Reed. “Entrepreneurship education helps scholars from all socioeconomic backgrounds to think outside the box and nurture unconventional talents and skills. It creates opportunities, ensures social justice, instills confidence and stimulates the economy. Congratulations to all involved on a successful day.” See more photos:  ALSO READ: Penryn acknowledges its sport stars
