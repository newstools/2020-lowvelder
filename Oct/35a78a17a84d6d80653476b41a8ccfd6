“In February Surgiclinic Fertility officially opened its doors to the region and her two neighbouring countries,” said Dr Richard Joubert, medical director of this unique upmarket facility.  With the ever-popular Surgiclinic Private Hospital, known for its femina-type surgery already well established, it simply required the skills of the original architects combined with the enthusiasm of doctors André van Schalkwyk , Jean Nel, Pieter Steyn and Wilhelm Combrink, and adding to this – one of South Africa’s leading embryologists, Dr Cornelia van Zyl, and voila Surgiclinic Fertility was born!  The clinic got off to a flying start, despite the Covid-19 pandemic, with seven documented pregnancies to date. The grand prize for this prestigious facility came about on October 2 with the birth of Herman James Language whose mom, Sarah, was one of Surgiclinic Fertility’s earlier IVF patients.  “To sweeten things further, Herman shares a birthday with me,” added Joubert. Surgiclinic Fertility will thankfully bring many a trip to larger centres to an end for aspiring parents, saving them money, especially in these challenging financial times. “Let your fertility journey start with us!” concluded Joubert.
