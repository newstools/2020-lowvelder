Secret Sunrise is a global community that expresses the enjoyment of life through music, dance and yoga with public gatherings for locals held across the Lowveld once a month. Facilitators Tash Cope and Kerri Dunshea guided the group, with Cope saying it was the first public yoga gathering since the start of lockdown. “We like to do our events at the botanical garden because it is just so beautiful and everyone gets to experience nature,” she said. “We have many other events across the Lowveld, but we always enjoy the gardens as the setting for our yoga classes.
