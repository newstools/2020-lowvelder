Little Ferdie Potgieter (6) had very limited vision in his right eye and was battling with this complication, until his parents approached PCA for help. “I did not know that he needed to go for surgery until the occupational therapist at his school suggested he get his eyes tested,” said Ferdie’s mom, Nicky. Once his eyes were tested, it was discovered that he would need surgery if there was any hope that he would have better vision in the future.
