“Being diagnosed with breast cancer isn’t always a death sentence.” These are the words of Daleen Hoffman (39) regarding her experience with the disease. Hoffman was diagnosed with breast cancer almost exactly a year ago. “One morning after I had woken up, my husband and I felt a lump that definitely was not there the day before. “I have always been very aware of the threat of the disease as it is prevalent in my family. I made sure to go for frequent check-ups and did regular self-checks. The mammogram that I did last February was also clear,” Hoffman said. She acted proactively and immediately made an appointment with a doctor, who almost immediately referred her to another practitioner in Johannesburg. There she underwent two biopsies, that confirmed that the lump was positive for a hormone-related breast cancer. “I had one more theatre biopsy to ensure that it had not spread, which thankfully, it didn’t.”  Due to the nature of the cancer, Hoffman did not have to go through with chemo therapy or radiation treatment. “It is miracles like these that also helped me remain positive. Yes, I had cancer, but at least I didn’t have to go through chemo.” Hoffman had to have a double mastectomy, with reconstruction, and will soon undergo a hysterectomy as well. However, she said she does not feel like these procedures make her any less of a woman. “I had so much support from my husband. We both made peace with the fact that I might end up not having breasts at all. I also told my children this and made sure that I would remain the same mom who still laughed at their jokes. “My family is complete and I breastfed both my children for four years. To have breasts and a womb is a bonus. “That which I had, I am so thankful for. But just because I don’t have it anymore, doesn’t mean I am less of the woman than I was before,” Hoffman said.  –
