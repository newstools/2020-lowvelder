Owners Mona and Danie Wagenaar said their idea for the car wash initially started out as something completely different, but it is definitely something they have been dreaming about for a long time.  They said they had had their eye on franchising a well-known car wash that they first saw in Pretoria. However, when the lockdown happened due to Covid-19 the couple had more than enough time to think clearly about what they wanted – to honour being local. And what is more local than the Big 5?  As if that wasn’t local enough, well-known Lowveld cartoon artist, Ghost made his mark by doing their signage. Big 5 Car Wash is conveniently located at i’langa Mall which means you can drop your vehicle off for a wash while you shop.  With a variety of choices at affordable prices, you can choose what is best to spoil your car. You will leave with your vehicle looking and smelling brand new because, at Big 5 Car Wash, its motto is to ensure client satisfaction.
