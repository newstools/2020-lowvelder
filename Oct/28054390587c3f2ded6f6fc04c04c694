“The Meet the Artists campaign gives you a chance to get to know Uplands College’s very own artists,” said Sandile Maluleke, head of communications at Uplands.   “The campaign comprises a video of the learners explaining their final IEB examination artwork – their inspirations, the thinking behind their pieces and more. These videos are currently on our Uplands White River Facebook page, Instagram page and YouTube channel.   “This year has been a rollercoaster ride for all of us in education and our matrics have weathered the storm with incredible resilience and creativity,” said Schaum.  “They have missed out on so much this year and so we decided to hold a small exhibition of some of their best works. Many schools launched online digital exhibitions, but we felt that a screen simply cannot compete with the sensory experience of an artwork.  The show was up for a week and our matric class selected their best pieces from their year work theme, ‘Artivism’ and their IEB final examination theme, ‘2020 Vision’. I am so proud of the commitment and honesty shown.  They have responded to the theme with thought-provoking imagery that tackles real life issues that we are all grappling with this year.”   ALSO READ: At total peace with nature and themselves  The IEB examination theme reflected the beginning of a new decade and a time to reflect on the past and look to the future. It spoke of the debate about the future and analysis of the past, and the changes that are imminent for humanity. As young people who are about to enter the world as adults, the class of 2020 is invested in this era and will have its own vision of what the future will bring.
