While on the other hand, the defence team argued that there was no evidence at all against the accused since DNA tests were not even conducted. It further argued that the two were not a flight risk and therefore deserved bail. Outside the court, supporters of the politician from his home town, were joined by a few ANC members who showed their support by singing revolutionary songs. The EFF membership also made its presence felt as it too came in numbers in support of the victims.
