Families beginning their Christmas shopping early have handed retailers their biggest monthly sales boost in more than a decade. Retailers enjoyed their biggest monthly sales rise in a decade last month as children returned to school and office workers started getting back to work. September sales have given retailers early signs that consumers are starting their Christmas shopping earlier this year, which retailers are encouraging their customers to do in order to manage demand at Christmas and keep people safe. Retail experts have pointed out that Covid-19 gave retailers a good opportunity to examine how they deliver their products and services. Those who provide consumers with good choices and delivery efficiency are expected to make good returns in November and December. No matter how bad things get, people will always need to spend money on food, clothes, housewares and supplies. The trick is to get them to buy more from you and less elsewhere, which you can do by offering products that are natural fits for your existing categories.
