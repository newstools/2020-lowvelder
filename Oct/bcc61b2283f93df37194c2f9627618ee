The Nkomazi Local Municipality (NLM) has been shut down by the protesters and no one has been allowed entry, hampering daily services. According to protest organisers, the municipality has allegedly misallocated Covid-19 relief funds amounting to R27 million. They are also accusing NLM of employing more than 200 people without following proper procedures, such as advertising the vacancies. More updates will follow as Lowvelder monitors the situation.
