During a previous March/April holiday Lizette Roodt and her husband came across something not every Kruger National Park (KNP) visitor sees every day. “One morning, very early, we were on the S79 in search of leopards when we came across the hare and the python,” said Roodt. “It was the most breathtaking event, mostly because it took place over such a long period of time. What was even more impressive was just how big the python could open its mouth.  “We sat there for more than two hours watching the scene unfold.”      The couple usually spend about 10 days in the park which they divide between Lower Sabie and Satara. They also ensure that they have a river view so that nightlife can be enjoyed to the full. “Just this past October holiday we saw three lions catch a blue wildebeest right in front of our riverfront tent.” ALSO READ: Community Can Challenge completes 16th food drop-off They are from Rustenburg and try to visit the KNP at least three times a year. Even though this python kill took place during an earlier vacation, Roodt only recently gained access to the media on her laptop whereafter she shared the experience with fellow nature lovers on the SANParks – Kruger National Park Facebook group.
