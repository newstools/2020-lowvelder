“A huge thank you to all the hospice volunteers and the community for supporting us. With your help and support we can continue to care for those who need it most. What a great turnout!” said Elmarie du Toit of Nelspruit Hospice. The event was held at the organisation’s premises at 84 Ferreira Street from 10:00 to 14:00. Goods for sale included preserved figs, Hospice Honey, household goods, books and more. Also on offer was the frames that are available as part of the Reflections project. “Nelspruit Hospice would like to encourage the community to support us in this unique fundraiser and to get creative for a good cause,” said Du Toit.
