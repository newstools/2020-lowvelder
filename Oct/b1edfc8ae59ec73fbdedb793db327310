An incident occurred in the Kruger National Park (KNP) on September 27 – vehicles were seen driving into the veld to get a better view of a leopard kill. KNP management warned guests of the consequences of not following park rules and regulations. According to Isaac Phaahla, spokesperson for the park, the punishments could either be a fine of R2 000 or a person may even be banned from the Kruger. They were notified by guests of the incident. On this date, vehicles were seen driving into the veld close to Shingwedzi to obtain a better view of a leopard kill being dragged under a bush. The sighting caught numerous guests’ attention, which also meant they were witness to the transgression.

Where possible, witnesses are encouraged to take down the details of the incident and take footage – of the guilty person, date, time, location, vehicle registration/licence plate, yellow decal number if there is, and so on. If the KNP’s law officers were not witnesses to a transgression themselves, culprits can contest the matter in court if they are charged. In some cases it might be necessary for the person who witnessed an incident to provide a sworn affidavit and testify in court if they are willing. The park is following up the incident and management said it appreciates this kind of feedback as guest participation in the management of the KNP is of great importance to it.
