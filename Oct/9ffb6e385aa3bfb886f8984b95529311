Monica Arnott, organiser of the market, said, “Each month we focus on a different charity and invite them to come and exhibit. The Nelspruit Lions Club and Nelspruit United are regulars. I am thinking of inviting Pro-Life Pet Rescue for the month of October.”  Besides the charity organisations, other stalls offered anything from fresh produce and fudge, to pillow covers and recycled glass bottles with fairy lights.  “Lodge Nelspruit United No 1 402 is a Masonic lodge on the roll of The Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland. They raised R1 700 for CANSA SA from the sale of prego and boerewors rolls.  “The Dasha Foundation had a stall selling home-made items made at Dasha. We also donate second-hand books to their stall that we collected during the month.  “Nelspruit Lions Club sold Christmas cake and caipirinhas (cocktails) and raised just over R2 500 for their fundraising initiatives.” ALSO READ: Hikers take a ramble to Devil’s Bridge on eSwatini border  Even though there were fewer feet in town due to the long weekend, Arnott said the vendors sold out most of their products.  “I also arranged extra food stalls this month. Exhibitors reported lovely sales and most have committed to the October market already.  “Our small community initiative is turning into a successful market and I am extremely pleased with the results. I would like to say a massive thank you to all those who came out and supported us.  “I would also like to thank André van Dyk of AVD Security for going above and beyond in providing us with security (for free) and so much more,” Arnott said.
