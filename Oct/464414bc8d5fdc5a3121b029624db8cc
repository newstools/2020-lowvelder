“We need scarves and beanies! They are so much fun to make and we need as many as possible by the end of the year,” Penny Boden said. “We have women who have not knitted or crocheted for years who have taken up the challenge and are churning out beautiful scarves.” According to Boden, once they have collected all the donations, these will be given to underprivileged children next year on July 8. “We hope to give each child in a rural primary school their own bright and warm scarf. On July 8, 67 Blankets for Mandela Day celebrates its annual Scarf Day.” ALSO READ: SPAR rewards their loyal Lowveld customers In addition to getting a scarf, each child will receive a matching beanie. Should anyone want to contribute to this project, please ensure your scarves are about 150 centimetres by 15 centimetres using any pattern, wool or colours. These can be handed at Camp & Gas, Mbombela or in White River at Sabie Valley Coffee Shop by mid-December. Enquiries: Penny Boden on 082-875-6691.
