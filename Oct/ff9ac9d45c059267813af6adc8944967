Teachers play one of the most vital roles in society. On Monday it was World Teachers Day. Franklin Darteh, a mathematics teacher from Penryn College, is one of those teachers in Mbombela who goes that extra mile. His dream of becoming an educator was inspired by his mathematics teacher.  “I struggled with mathematics in primary school. When I got to high school, my mathematics teacher changed my perspective on the subject. He helped me become the top student in the school and since then mathematics has been easy for me. His efforts and hard work resulted in me dedicating my life in trying to help learners over- come their fear of mathematics. I enjoy teaching because it provides me with an opportunity to be memorable in the lives of young people,” he explained. Darteh believes that life is a mathematical equation.

Everything around us is numbers.” He urged young people to stop viewing mathematics as a difficult subject. “It is a false perception that has been created in the minds of young people. If a student tells me that mathematics is difficult, I ask them two simple questions. Who told you that it is difficult? If it is difficult, what are you doing about it? “This subject is about constant practice, seeking further explanation from teachers and paying attention in class.” After 12 years of teaching, he still prepares and does research on the subject.
