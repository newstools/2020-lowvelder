There are a number of items you can use to make sure your closet is organised. Deals for most of these items can be found in a variety of catalogues on Guzzle. 1. Use drawer and shelf dividers Drawer and shelf dividers are great for organising your closet because they help section it off in equal parts, making sure that everything stays in its designated space. It’s easy for closets to get messy, requiring you to constantly reorder them. Drawer and shelf dividers will prevent this from happening. Look for some deals on boards and have them cut to the size you need. 2. Hanger organisers Hanger organisers are, just as the name suggests, organisers for your hangers. Hangers tend to take up a lot of closet space, hanger organisers are designed to make sure that your closet space is used more efficiently. These are definitely a must-have for organising your closet this spring! 3. Shoe pockets Shoe pockets are efficient closet organisers that help you maximise space by placing all your shoes in one place. They are plastic and consist of many pockets where your shoes can be stored. You can hang your shoe pockets in the closet or even behind your door. This certainly beats having to put your shoes in the bottom of your closet and struggling with space. 4. Get a coat hanger stand A coat hanger stand can help you free up some space in your closet. It can also be aesthetically pleasing to have one of these in your bedroom where you hang a few of your most worn coats and jackets. 5. Add some extra drawers Drawers are a good solution if you have a lot of closet space or would like an extra ‘dresser’ in your room. These usually come with 3 or 4 baskets, helping you organise your items properly. The best part is that some of them are transparent, which will help you locate what you need easily. Now that you have the knowledge, go find the tools you will require to assist you in pulling off that closet transformation.
