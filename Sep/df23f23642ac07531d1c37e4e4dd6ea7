South Africa’s beverage industry is a big contributor to the country’s economic wellbeing, with alcohol being a big part of the country’s social scene. The alcohol ban on 27th March necessitated by rising Covid-19 infections therefore had far reaching repercussions. The initial alcohol ban was lifted on 1st June but was reinstated on 12 July without warning, making South Africa the only country that re-introduced a complete prohibition on alcohol sales. On Saturday (15 August), South African president Cyril Ramaphosa announced that the suspension of the sale of alcohol would be lifted subject to certain restrictions. The lifting of the ban was effected from 17th August. Some of the conditions attached to the lifting of the ban include the fact that alcohol will be permitted for on-site consumption in licensed establishments only up until 10pm. Liquor outlets will be allowed to sell alcohol for off-site consumption from Monday to Thursday during the hours of 9am to 5pm only. A quick check around Crown Mines and Roodepoort showed consumers pushing trolleys filled with their favourite alcoholic drinks. Speaking in an interview, Thumelo Khosi who is the owner of C4 Grill Lounge, expressed delight with the development. “I’m actually glad that the ban has been lifted, we can go back to business. Some of us are fortunate to go back to business, I know a few who don’t have the capital to go back to business and I hope South Africans will behave and observe the rules so that we don’t go back to the ban, with families lacking income, being forced to stay home and no work. I hope we never go back,” said Tumelo. Daniel Sonde who runs a township tavern also expressed delight. “I’m the owner of a local tavern, I’m happy we are able to buy drinks because it’s been hectic. Thank God we can have business, it’s better than nothing.” The beverage and alcohol industries have definitely begun their journey towards recovery.
