In the spirit of rhino month and with World Rhino Day approaching, the Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary is doing a countdown to this day – September 22. According to the sanctuary’s Instagram page, “to spread awareness and celebrate the lives of the orphans, the Care for Wild (CFW) team is embarking on the Creative Kilometres Challenge.” The challenge kicked-off on September 1 and the idea is to find “fun ways to travel the same distance in kilometres as the date”. It also invited the public to join in. ALSO READ: Illegal sand mining could topple crucial Eskom tower “You can join in too! Take part daily or whenever you can… take the challenge! You must have something rhino related with you! Ask your friends to join you. Post your challenge photos to social media and tag @careforwild #cfwcreativekmschallenge.” And so the challenge commenced on September 1 with Petronel Nieuwoudt and her team having a fun-filled walk around the Care for Wild property.  3,2,1 GO!!! The CFW creative kilometers challenge has officially begun! To raise awareness and celebrate the lives of the rhinos, we are finding creative ways to travel the same distance as the date! We will be increasing our distance daily as we count down to World Rhino Day! You can join in too. Take part for just one day or the whole 21! It’s up to you to take the challenge! Post your photos to social media and tag @careforwild #cfwcreativekmschallenge We challenge you!!!!!!! ???????????????????????? #careforwildrhinosanctuary #careforwilld #rhino #rhinoconservation #worldrhinoday #challenge #getactive #walk #run #cycle #skip #fun #rhinoawareness A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 2, 2020 at 3:25am PDT  September 2 – completed with wheelbarrows and an unexpected guest even joined in for the walk.  It’s day 2 of the challenge and today the CFW team travelled 2km creatively with wheelbarrows! A lot of fun was had! Our fabulous chef also joined (he’s still wearing his hat!) and two unexpected visitors meant that our rather raucous parade, became a calm and quiet procession, as we moved out of their way! #summer #arthurthebrave #cfwcreativekmschallenge #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 2, 2020 at 11:12am PDT  September 3 – 3 kilometres with some heavy breathing here and there. Included was the introduction of one of the newest additions to the Care for Wild orphan family.  It’s day 3 of the challenge and the thought of 21km is quite daunting! But we will not be beaten! At CFW we work hard, have fun, and save rhinos!!! #cfwcreativekmschallenge #careforwildrhinosanctuary #careforwild #rhinoawareness #savetherhino #rhinoconservation #rhino #worldrhinoday #rhino A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 3, 2020 at 10:05am PDT  Some girl power was shown with the 4 kilometres on September 4.  It’s day 4 of the challenge and we are reminded that we are doing this “all 4 rhinos”! Today the girls joined the APU members for a 100m relay until our cumulative efforts reached 4KM! Even the horses joined in! Join us tomorrow for a nighttime 5km! #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #challenge #cfwcreativekmschallenge #raiseawareness #rhino #worldrhinoday A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 4, 2020 at 11:11am PDT  September 5 was more awareness than celebration as a march was done during a full moon – also known as a poacher’s moon. ALSO READ: Lowvelders to be on high alert for fires  It’s day 5 of the challenge! Full Moon, otherwise known as Poacher’s Moon, is always a situation of high alert. Under the light of the moon, poachers move easily without the aid of torches. Petronel and the team embark on a 5km full moon walk with members of the APU as we acknowledge and thank those who work throughout the night to protect rhinos and keep them safe. #notonourwatch #stoppoaching #endwildlifecrime #stoprhinopoaching #careforwildrhinosanctuary #careforwild #cfwcreativekmschallenge #fullmoon #moonwalk A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 5, 2020 at 11:51am PDT  September 6’s distance of 6 kilometres was done with some singing involved.  It’s day 6 of the challenge and today we run for rhinos, rhino for the youth, run for the future and celebrate life! #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #thisisafrica #africa #cfwcreativekmschallenge #run #awareness #rhinoconservation #investec #yesprogram #youth #future #sing #oneteamonedream A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 6, 2020 at 8:48am PDT  September 7 – The new orphan arrival was named on this 7 kilometre day. The name Ranger was decided on in honour of the rangers who assisted in his rescue.  It’s day 7 of the challenge and a whole week since our newest rhino orphan arrived. It seems like the absolute perfect opportunity to thank the amazing Timbavati team for working so hard to complete this rescue mission and acknowledge the complete dedication of Conservation Officer Jandrè Coetzee, who ran 7km keeping up with the baby until the vets could arrive! In honor of these efforts and those of Corporal Fredrick Ndlovou and his team, Dr Joel Alves, helicopter pilot Gerrry McDonald and Edwin Pierce Section Warden, we can officially announce this little rhino’s name is, Ranger! Ranger met his new crash today, fellow orphans, Anchor, Yster and Cotton who welcomed him instantly. #careforwildrhinosanctuary #careforwild #rhinoconservation #babyrhino #oneteamonedream #everyrhinomatters A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 7, 2020 at 10:52am PDT  September 8 – broom and rake day in celebration of keeping a clean and safe environment for rhinos. Also keeping the people in mind who were on the lookout for a baby rhino in the Kruger National Park (the rhino was later found and taken to CFW).  It’s all about the effort! Day 8 of the challenge saw the team utilizing the tools that they use on a daily basis to clean the bomas and night pens of the rhinos. The 8km was cut short however, when a call from the Kruger National Park meant that the team had to leave, to help search for another orphan. While the rest of CFW continued to complete the challenge later in the day, the SANParks team will continue the search for the calf throughout the night. Never give up. Every rhino matters. #oneteamonedream #careforwild #rhinoorphan #cfwcreativekilometerschallenge A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 8, 2020 at 10:07am PDT  On September 9 the K9 Unit took up the challenge and did a 9 kilometre patrol to check the fence.

September 10 saw medical, healthcare and veterinary professionals rising to the challenge.  Today’s 10km is inspired by the medical, healthcare, and veterinary professionals who have worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic. @er24ems have been long time supporters of Care for Wild. Over the years, their generous donations of medical supplies, have allowed us to treat many brutal and life-threatening injuries. From machete and bullet wounds to vicious attacks by hyena, it is not uncommon to receive an orphaned rhino calf with horrendous wounds. With the recent arrival of five new calves, we are in urgent need of certain medical supplies to restock our emergency bag and ICU. If you are able to help by donating towards the purchase of these items, please visit the story board or www.rhinomarket.org #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #medicalsuppies #rapidresponse #emergency #cfwcreativekmschallenge A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 10, 2020 at 9:40am PDT  The Lomshiyo Community Project was visited for September 11’s 11 kilometres. Nieuwoudt said she felt inspired by the youth surrounding her.  The 11km took place at the Lomshiyo Community Project. The joint farming venture between CFW and the Lomshiyo Community has created over 30 jobs already. This week, the spinach is being harvested! The first harvest! There is a raw and pure energy in this place. The energy of the youth is inspirational and gives us hope for a brighter future. Save rhinos, to save people, to save tomorrow. #careforwild #community #veggiegarden #sustainable #youth #future #hope #freshfood #earlymorning #inspirational A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 11, 2020 at 12:22pm PDT  September 12 saw the Care for Wild extended family joining in, supporting and celebrating rhino lives.  When the road seems long, good family, friends and supporters, are just what you need. We were overwhelmed by these amazing willing hearts and hands. An incredible group of people who came to walk the 12 km with us and celebrate the lives of rhinos. All generations joined the fight to save the rhino today. We will always go the extra mile…or kilometre…for rhinos. #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #savetherhino #rhinoconservation #walking #walkingclub #notonourwatch #endwildlifecrime A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 12, 2020 at 10:58pm PDT  On 13 kilometres, a tractor got involved, showing how staff go about their day to day tasks. September 13 was definitely a Sunday fun day at the sanctuary.  Sunday Funday at Care for Wild Rhino Sanctuary. Today we give you a little peek into the life of the tractor and the important role it plays in caring for the rhinos. Amongst all the hard work, there is always time for some fun! Today we are celebrating rhinos and the return of Summer! The nice warm weather will soon bring the much needed rains but until then, we will just have to get creative with ways to cool off…..watch until the end!!!!! #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #cfwcreativekmschallenge #rhinoconservation #tractor #tractorride #gopro #awareness #savetherhinon #summer #heatwave A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 13, 2020 at 12:06pm PDT  On September 14, black rhino, Swazi, was taken on her daily walk to get used to the veld as part of the 14 kilometres.  Establishing the right intentions can help you stay positive and optimistic during challenging times. When we started the creative kilometers challenge, our intention was to spread awareness and celebrate the lives of rhinos. Today’s 14km is being undertaken by Lucas and 20 month old rhino calf, Swazi. Swazi is a black rhino and she is critically endangered. In preparation for her rewilding and reintroduction back into the wild, Lucas walks Swazi into the veldt every day to teach her how to browse and navigate the bush. Saving rhinos does take commitment, positivity and faith. It’s rhino month, we need to save them! Believe you can and you are half way there! #careforwild #cfwcreativekmschallenge #blackrhino #criticallyendangered #savetherhino #rhinoconservation #rehabilitation #rewild #release #swazi #rhinobaby workingwithwildlife #walking #goat #animalfriends #positive A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 14, 2020 at 12:21pm PDT  Rhino ambassador, Matt Meyer, joined in on September 15 and told of his efforts to save rhinos. He handled the 15 kilometres with ease.  It’s day 15 of the challenge and we need to remember the importance of endurance! Never give up! The road to saving the rhino from extinction will take endurance. Today, our very good friend and rhino ambassador, Matt Meyer joined Petronel for the 15km! Matt is no stranger to long distances and endurance. In 2017 he towed a life size rhino with his bicycle across the West Coast of America in a 60 day fundraising marathon. Each day is getting tougher but we will not give up the challenge and we will not stop fighting to save this iconic species. @rhinoride2017 #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #awareness #15km #cfwcreativekmschallenge #worldrhinoday2020 #countdown #rhinoconservation #endurance #nevergiveup A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 15, 2020 at 10:29am PDT  Another rhino conservation ambassador, Kevin Pietersen, accepted the challenge on September 16 and did 16 kilometres on his bike all the way in Dubai.  @kp24 has accepted the 16km challenge! ???????? Rhino conservation ambassador and CFW’s dear friend, Kevin Pietersen, is jumping on his bike today to help us save rhinos! @kp24 is vibrantly and heavily involved in rhino conservation initiatives and through his own brand @oursorai and his collaboration with @hublot, is providing funding and support to rhino conservation and antipoaching projects that are working to save this iconic keystone species from extinction. Thank you so much @kp24 for your unwavering dedication, commitment and love for our rhinos and the conservation and protection of our heritage. We can’t wait for your cycling updates today!

It was a mixture of marching, running and fitness. Physical fitness plays an important role in the fight against rhino poaching.  Boots on the ground. Today’s 17km was completed by our anti-poaching unit in a combination of marching, running and fitness. The final kilometers were covered in ease by our speedy mounted unit; tough terrain is not battle for them! Maintaining physical fitness and continual training is an essential element of managing an anti-poaching unit. In a role that requires a high level of physical fitness, endurance is key. Today we thank those people who are protecting and fighting for rhinos. Today we salute those men and women who protect our wildlife and heritage. @magnum_boots_africa @hitec_sa #careforwild #careforwildrhinosanctuary #rhinoconservation #antipoaching #worldrhinoday #heritage #southafrica #cfwcreativekmschallenge #fitness #marching #horse #mountedunit A post shared by  Care For Wild Rhino Sanctuary (@careforwild) on Sep 17, 2020 at 5:44am PDT  That leaves four days to go as the Care for Wild team counts down to World Rhino Day on September 22.
