The Komatipoort Police Station is temporarily closed after members tested positive for Covid-19. As a result, the Community Service Centre will operate from the Komatipoort SAPS cell offices at the police station. The Mpumalanga police spokesperson, Brig Leonard Hlathi, said, “To access the station, the community can call 0794999597 for all emergencies and complaints which will be attended to.” The telephone lines at Komatipoort Police Station Community Service Centre will not be accessible for the duration of the closure. However, service delivery will not be hampered. The building will be decontaminated and services will resume normally at the station on Tuesday. The SAPS management in Mpumalanga apologizes for any inconvenience that may arise from this. The Station Commander Luitenant Colonel Louis Stander can also be contacted on 082-449-0242.
