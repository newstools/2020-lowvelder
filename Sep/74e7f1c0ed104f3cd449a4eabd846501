The Farmers Market @ Sonpark is scarcely three months old and it has already had to add an extra night to accommodate all the exhibitors. The market was started by Koos Schoonraad along with Kobus Jacobs of Sonpark Centre and Pauline Moller, to provide a platform for locals to generate an income. Elmarie Schoonraad expressed her gratitude to all the exhibitors that took part and mentioned that she hoped that the market was a success for them. “The market is more for them to be able to get some extra income than it is for us,” she said. The next market will be held on October 2 and 3.
