WHITE RIVER – According to Estelle Carlin, owner of Route 40 Farm Stall and Eatery, it is unknown what the exact cause of the fire was, although it is suspected to have started in Antiques and Gracious Living because of the major damage that took place there. Lalka Brown, owner of Antiques and Gracious Living, mentioned that her shop had burned to the ground.  The insulation in the Route 40 side caught alight and quickly spread to that side of the building, although firefighters managed to prevent the restaurant from burning to the ground. Carlin went on to mention that after the fire, at around 03:00, suspects allegedly broke into the building and stole the undamaged goods. The Wardrobe, another shop in the building, was fortunately not too badly damaged, although there is some smoke damage and the shop will also be closed for a couple of days.  According to Jchaan de Beer of Hi-Tech White River, it is suspected that the fire started at around 20:30. “We suspect a short circuit, but we’re still unsure,” De Beer said.
