Here are our top 5 cocktails you should try this spring. Search Guzzle for deals on some or all of the ingredients you will require: 1. Cherry Berry A cherry berry cocktail is a blend of cherry and berry flavours. It’s the perfect combination of sweet and sour to balance out the strong taste of liquor and when chilled, it is a refreshing drink. All you need for this are cherries, berries of your choice, a berry-flavoured liquor (like vodka), cherry-flavoured cordial, Sprite and crushed ice. Mix a shot or two of berry-flavoured liquor with Sprite and the cherry-flavoured cordial. Add some crushed ice and sprinkle in some of the cherries and berries for aesthetic. It’s simple to make and delicious to taste! 2. Grapefruit Gin & Tonic This is a twist on the classic gin and tonic. All you need to do is to mix gin and tonic with some freshly squeezed grapefruit juice. Or alternatively, you can cut grapefruit slices and put them in your gin and tonic. 3. Red Sangria Red Sangria is a classic Spanish cocktail which has fruit, orange juice, sweetener (brown sugar) brown liquor, dry red wine and ice. To make this traditional drink from Spain, you just have to mix sugar and fruit (preferably apples and oranges) into a pitcher and stir with a wooden spoon, add red wine, brandy and orange juice and continue stirring. If you’d like to add more sugar, then do so. Continue tasting as you stir to create the best flavour. And there you have it, Spain in a glass! You can purchase these ingredients at great prices from retailers on Guzzle.
