The sudden halt of the construction at the Potgieter, Voortrekker and De Clerq street intersection has raised concerns. Last week, motorists voiced their concern when they noticed that the workers were not on site. The public feared that if the project was interrupted it might affect the completion time, since Potgieter, Voortrekker and De Clerq streets are closed. This results in delays in town during peak hours. The construction on this 1,1-kilometre stretch was estimated to take six months to complete. Since the project commenced some motorists said they needed to leave their homes earlier than usual since it took longer to reach their destinations. According to Themba Sibiya, communications manager of Thaba Chweu Local Municipality (TCLM), the project has not stopped.
