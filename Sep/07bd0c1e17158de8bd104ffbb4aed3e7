The reservoir is situated in Vakansiedorp in Hazyview and overflows into the streets at least once a month, according to residents. Hazyview local, Debbie Olivier said the reservoir overflows often and runs into the roads, damaging sidewalks and driveways in the process. “The reservoir pumps need to be switched off manually otherwise it overflows. This is not the first or second time this has happened. Sometimes the water runs for two or three days,” she said. Another resident, who asked not to be named, said the constant overflowing of the reservoir had damaged her driveway and worn the tar down, leaving a big hole. She said she had recently repaired the hole, but the water from the reservoir yesterday had already started to erode the repairs. She said she saw the water running down the road yesterday at around 15:30 and called the municipality.

She said the overflowing reservoir was “a waste of water” and should be addressed as soon as possible.
