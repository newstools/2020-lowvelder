The website is to focus on the marketing of the Kruger Lowveld Region as a tourism destination to both domestic and international visitors. The KLCB calls on all tourism products in the region (effectively from the eSwatini border to Phalaborwa and from the Mozambique border to the R36) whether they are accommodation, restaurants, attractions, activities,
tourism-focused retail or tourism services, to send their contact details, name of the business or establishment along with a brief description, to news@krugerlowveld.com. The KLCBT also wishes to be informed about any new developments regarding tourism in the region. The details can be sent to the email address above. Once it has received the information, the KLCBT will contact the relevant business and request further information, which will then be included on the new website. The deadline for submissions is Friday, September 18. ALSO READ: Poverty-stricken community of Zwelishane Trust left without clean water
