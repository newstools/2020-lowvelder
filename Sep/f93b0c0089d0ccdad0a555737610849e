It has become customary for Lowveld Media to shine at the Caxton Excellence Awards, and this year was no different. Lowvelder with Buks Esterhuizen won the best sold newspaper for 2019 and Mpumalanga News was also a finalist in this category. Lowvelder was named the best front page of the year and the judges noted that the design team (Jacques Erasmus,Wessel Cöhrs, Martel Weweje and Mojalefa Nthutang) pushed the boundaries of traditional layout and produced thought-provoking, bold and interesting front pages. The executions are versatile and do not follow one style, creating a spicy variety. Neil Henning won the best written and designed large advertisement category with “Renovate Revamp Refresh” which appeared in the Get It Lowveld magazine of September 2019. The winner of the best multimedia campaign went to Zani Barrish, Colletha Noppê and Geraldine Reyneke with “Crossing Centre Sweet 16”. The judges commended the winning entry for making good use of all platforms available and cashed in on it, giving the clients value for their spend. In the best community involvement category Zani Barrish and Julia Burger walked away at the winners with their Lemon Challenge campaign that helped raise money for victims of Cyclone Idai. Their Heart co Clean campaign also got a special mention in this category. In the best advertisement features (one to four pages) category the winner was the Lowvelder team consisting of Matthys Ferreria and Hannelie van Rensburg with eight motor features. Best original idea went to Lowvelder‘s Zani Barrish, Colletha Noppê and Julia Burger with their #MacBust campaign.
