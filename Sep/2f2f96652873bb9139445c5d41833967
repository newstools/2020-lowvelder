The 20 students from Mpumalanga who graduated in July from Russian state universities are back home and ready to serve. All of these graduates were treated to a hero’s welcome when they returned home last Thursday. They are among the first to be sent to different universities in the Russian Federation through a programme called Russian African University Services (RACUS).

He said there were doomsayers who wanted to see the programme fail.

The MEC for education, Bonakele Majuba, congratulated the students and wished them well as they returned home and reunited with their families.
