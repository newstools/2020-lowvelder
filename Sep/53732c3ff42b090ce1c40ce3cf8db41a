Over these past years, WOF has grown from just 850 veld and forest firefighters to a globally renowned programme employing more than 5 000 people. Unemployed young people are recruited from disadvantaged communities into the programme, going a long way to creating opportunities for South African youth.  During September, WOF will focus on a campaign to highlight and showcase these past 17 years, with the theme being “17 Years of Successful Partnerships”.  These partnerships include WOF’s long-standing partnerships with DEFF, national and local government entities, public and private landowners, and fire protection associations such as Lowveld Escarpment and Fire Protection Association.
