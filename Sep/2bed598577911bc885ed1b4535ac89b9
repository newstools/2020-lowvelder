The truck that went over the side of the bridge at Crocodile Bridge earlier today, has been removed. After obstructing the bridge for the larger part of September 21, it was confirmed that the area is now cleared. Van Wettens arrived on the scene at around 17:30, and managed to get the truck back onto the bridge. The truck was, however, only cleared at about 19:30. After the incident occurred, the Crocodile Bridge Gate was closed for the day because clearing the scene was expected to take some time.
