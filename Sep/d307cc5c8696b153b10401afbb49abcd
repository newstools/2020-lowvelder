Is there anything more South African than a shisa nyama! South Africans all love to unite around the fire, be it over weekends, after a hard dayâ€™s work, to celebrate special days and events, or to spend time with family and friends. To heat up your Heritage Day celebrations this year, SPAR is giving you the opportunity to WIN 1 of 5, Proudly South African, Chef Charcoal Leisure 830 Braais plus a R500 SPAR Voucher for your braai buddy.  Simply snap and share a photo of your braai fire and post in the comments in the Heritage Day competition post on our SPAR Lowveld Facebook page. Remember to include the following hashtags: #sparlowveld and #myfire. Tag your braai buddy and share the post. The competition ends September 20 and winners will be randomly drawn on September 21 and contacted via Messenger. Ts & Cs apply.
