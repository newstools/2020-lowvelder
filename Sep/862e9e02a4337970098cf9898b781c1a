She said the national Department of Health had reported 25 425 confirmed cases in Mpumalanga, but the additional four cases were misallocations from other provinces. “The epidemiological data shows that the number of recorded cases has been decreasing over the past week, consistent with the subsequent three weeks. “The province has recorded a 95 per cent recovery rate. Over 23 900 patients have recovered from Covid-19 in Mpumalanga, with 983 active cases. Regrettably, 442 Covid-19 deaths have been reported,” she said. Manzini said Nkangala Manzini said the Nkangala District still accounts for the majority of cases in the province, with 38 per cent of all confirmed ones. “Ehlanzeni has the highest number of active cases with 362 (37 per cent active cases). “Subdistricts with the highest number of active cases in Mpumalanga are the City of Mbombela, eMalahleni, Govan Mbeki and Steve Tshwete. These areas accounted for the majority of hospitalisations in the province. “These subdistricts remain high-risk areas and the department continues to monitor them closely,” she continued. As of September 10, Mpumalanga recorded 442 Covid-19-related deaths. The majority were in the Gert Sibande District.  Subdistricts that recorded the highest number of deaths are eMalahleni, Steve Tshwete and Msukaligwa. A total of 1 534 healthcare workers have been exposed to Covid-19, recording 1 896 primary contacts as at September 10. Nkangala is leading with the number of healthcare workers exposed, followed by Ehlanzeni and Gert Sibande. The province has lost 12 healthcare workers to Covid-19. “The data shows that nurses are more exposed compared to other categories in all the districts. This could be because they spend more time with Covid-19 positive patients,” said Manzini.
