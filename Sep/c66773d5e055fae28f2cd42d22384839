Plastic straws are really bad for the ocean. We as South Africans use more than 15 million tons of plastic waste per year, and most of that ends up in our oceans, polluting the water and killing marine life and wildlife. Bio Straws encourages people to stop using plastic straws for good. If we don’t act now, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.  This problem is not the straw or product, but the polymer from which it is manufactured. Many countries have banned this due to the lack of ability for them to produce the products that are biodegradable due to costs and availability of biodegradable compounds and lack of compostable landfills. Tanzania, Uganda, South Africa and Kenya have already banned thin plastic bags, while Rwanda and Somalia have done so completely. Mali and Mauritania have been the next countries in Africa to ban non-biodegradable plastic bags. Africa is high on the list for bans as biodegradable compounds are not available and expensive to local markets. Kenya is the latest country to ban polythene plastic bags. Similar measures are reported to be in effect in at least nine other African countries. However, of the nine, only Rwanda has been successful in enforcing the ban. In neighbouring Uganda, for example, the move away from plastic has been slow. Countries like China have begun to restrict the use of plastic bags within their country. Italy became the first European country to ban non-biodegradable bags.  France is soon to follow suit, with many cities across the globe. From Pakistan to the United States, countries have begun to ban non-biodegradable plastic bags. Mexico is also in the lead to manufacture straws and cutlery which are biodegradable. Paper straws are not the solution as replacing one for the other. Producing paper straws uses 10 time more material than a plastic straw when compared to earth’s resources.
