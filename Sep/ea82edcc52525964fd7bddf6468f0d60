The school set a goal of 700 kilometres for the day, but more than doubled the goal, ending the day with just over 1 800 kilometres. Hoërskool Rob Ferreira’s marketing manager, Loanette Caknis said the event was initially only for teachers, but with lots of interest from parents it was decided that members of the SGB could also join in. Cakins said some people made donations to the school while others were sponsored an amount for each kilometre they completed, either by cycling around the school grounds, spinning on a stationary bike or walking. “It was a great day, everyone had lots of fun and we beat our goal to reach 700 kilometres,” said Caknis. Mrs Mpumalanga 2021 finalist, Annelize Botha was also at Saturday’s event to show her support. She said she had chosen the virtual event as one of her foundation charity events and was happy with how the day turned out. While some teachers and learners cycled around the school and others were spinning, some took a break to play a friendly game of volleyball and braai.
