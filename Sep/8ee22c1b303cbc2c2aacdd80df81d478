Society members gathered eagerly at the entrance to the garden on Saturday morning (September 19), excited to look around at all the flowers, trees and plants. Frank Webb, the society chairperson, said everyone was “positive and happy to be out for a walk in the garden”. “Everyone is quite excited. No one has been able to visit it since lockdown,” he said. Webb said the society meets once a month at the Lowveld Botanical Garden to try and get to know and identify different and new plants.

However, the show was cancelled this year due to Covid-19. He said the society last had an outing in February where there were talks about various plants and an excursion to the Kaapsehoop area.

Webb said the cycads were one of the garden’s strengths with a wide selection from all over South Africa. He added that the garden was quite dry at the moment.
