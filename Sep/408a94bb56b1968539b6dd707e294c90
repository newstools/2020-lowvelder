Adam MacIntyre has been at the helm of Emnotweni Casino since 2017. MacIntyre will be handing the baton on to Tobie van Schalkwyk, who will take up the Emnotweni reins from October 1. Ahead of the move to Durban, despite some sadness at leaving Emnotweni, MacIntyre is excited to take on the challenge of heading up another Tsogo Sun Gaming property. He does offer some advice to anyone considering a career in gaming, “Never forget that this is a people industry – don’t lose focus or hope, put in the hard yards and commit, and the opportunities will arise”. Looking back, on what he describes as “amazing whirlwind journey here in the Lowveld”, MacIntyre has nothing but praise for the tight knit community which made him feel most welcome. In fact, had he not been so well-suited to making a career in the casino industry, he would have tried his hand at being a game ranger – which is why the Lowveld was such a good fit for him.
