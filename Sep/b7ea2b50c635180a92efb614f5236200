The country’s move to level 1 of the national lockdown saw a significant increase in traffic on the N4 over the long weekend. According to Trans African Concessions (TRAC), figures peaked on Sunday with more than 1 900 vehicles (coming from both directions) passing at Middelburg Plaza per hour. A major traffic influx was also experienced at Machadodorp, with more than 1 500 vehicles (coming from both directions) passing per hour during the early to late afternoon. “This was the highest number of vehicles at these plazas recorded this year,” said TRAC’s spokesperson, Solange Soares. “Despite TRAC’s best efforts to accommodate the excessive traffic, which included having plazas operating at capacity and having route patrol teams, accident response units and the helpdesk on full alert, the elevated volumes affected travel time on the route,” she added.

TRAC apologised to all road users for the inconvenience and thanked them for their patience. “Although we understand the frustration caused by traffic backlogs, we are pleased to see how eager South Africans are to travel again. The improvements that are currently under way along the N4 will ensure an improved travel experience to our road users once concluded. We are also pleased to report that despite the heavy traffic along the route, only three accidents were recorded on Sunday, with no serious injuries or fatalities,” she concluded.
