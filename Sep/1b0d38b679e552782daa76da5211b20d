Municipalities in three districts across the province received the generous donation from Standard Bank in an effort to assist consumers. This donation of surgical masks, hands-free sanitiser stands, alcohol-based sanitiser solution, fumigation devices, face shields, refillable spray bottles and surgical gloves was done in response to governments call for assistance from private sector and individuals to assist the Department of Health in its battle against the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is our duty as the private sector to assist government in the fight against Covid-19. The local municipalities have been struggling with shortages of PPE and we hope that our contribution will provide much needed relief to the affected communities. This act demonstrates our commitment to the local community because without their support, we wouldn’t be the bank that we are today,” said Theunis Duvenhage, head of client coverage, Mpumalanga at Standard Bank. In addition to the donation the bank has also pledged its continued support and commitment to its clients and has been offering a wide variety of relief options such as basis payment holidays, instalment reduction, debt consolidation, interest rate reduction to insurance payment for lost income. The bank has also taken an active role in administering the South African Future Trust, which provides relief in the form of a five-year interest-free loan for SMMEs, for the purpose of supporting permanent employees of the business.
