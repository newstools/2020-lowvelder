The purpose of the visit was for Manzini to ensure that the college was complying with the Covid-19 regulations and requirements. She was given a detailed brief about the state of affairs at the college. The MEC was told that it had done a risk assessment to ensure that it is able to continue working under Covid-19 regulations.  There is a committee that was established that looks into the strict compliance of Covid-19 at this institution.
The college also conducted training for lectures, cleaners, students and others on compliance. “The country is currently facing challenges and we need all our healthcare workers to assist us to curb the spread. You must take your work seriously because every day in the health sector we encounter new challenges. You need to complete your studies so you can come back and assist us,” said Manzini. Since the screening started, only five officials at the college have tested positive. The college has, however, confirmed that there are no students who tested positive.
She was also briefed that the number of students currently is 65 because of social distance compliance.  The only students who are there are the ones writing exams, and the rest are studying online while at home. In Middelburg, Manzini visited the depot to inspect the availability of personal protective equipment and later proceeded to monitor the implementation of the clinic-based model aimed at maintaining balance in healthcare facilities by responding directly to Covid-19, while essential health services are delivered to people smoothly.
