 Penryn College was delighted to host its grade 12s for a morning under the trees on July 31. The marketing department coined it the “Matricnic”. Social distancing was maintained and each pupil received their own beautiful Class of 2020 blanket on which to enjoy their picnic. They can also use it during the upcoming exams. Masks were only removed to enjoy the delicious snacks and blue ice cream provided by Ella & Karl. The learners had a fun morning listening to music under the trees as they thoroughly enjoyed themselves.
