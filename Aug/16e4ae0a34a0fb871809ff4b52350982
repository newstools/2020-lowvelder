 A South African musician, called Master KG has sparked a frenzy which has taken the internet by storm, called the #JerusalemaDanceChallenge. The song has received more than 70 million views on YouTube.  It is reported that the trend started in Angola after a candid video was shared of the choreography and people then decided to take it further by making videos of themselves dancing to the catchy tune with their own moves, and then sharing it on social media.  The Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, has congratulated Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode on their global success for the hit song ‘Jerusalema’. “We are happy that you have put our country on the global map. You have used song and dance to unite the whole world. We note the collaboration with Burna Boy, a move that augers well with the government’s programme of strengthening our ties on the continent,” the minister said. Master KG said he was surprised when the song, released in December, reached one million views on YouTube after one week. Caxton Local Media would like to encourage our readers to join the #JerusalemaDanceChallenge movement and spread some positivity during these unprecedented times. We challenge you to share your #JerusalemaDanceChallenge videos with us. Let’s see your skills!
