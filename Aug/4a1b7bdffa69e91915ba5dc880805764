Subsequently we have been without sustainable work for almost five months. In fact, August 5 will mark five months,” he said. On this day there will be a public stand taken with a campaign called #LightSARed. Everyone in the events industry is encouraged to light up a place or object in red and gather a national presence.
“With this campaign we are looking at a civil way to make our voices heard as a collective and to find a solution to a situation affecting many in a severe manner,” he said. With this campaign the industry demands that government and financial institutions extend financial relief to those who earn a living in the technical production and live events industry, until they are permitted to resume work.

Nel encouraged locals to join the campaign by lighting any object red, taking a photo and sharing it on social media using the #LightSARed. To sign up and for more information, visit www.lightsared.org.za.
