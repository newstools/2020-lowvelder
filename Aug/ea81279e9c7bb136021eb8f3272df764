 Especially relevant to the Lowveld and its many tour operators, the newly detailed regulations as gazetted on August 6, was the last piece to fall in place before guides would be allowed into parks to provide tours. Along with these regulations came clarity surrounding overnight accommodation that is also now allowed at various facilities – as long as you stay within your home province.

A “nuclear family” is defined as follows: “includes other family members or caregivers living in the same household”. Even though this would imply that a family of four could share accommodation, transport regulations regarding capacity have not yet been amended to allow, for example, a family of four travelling in a sedan, to enter a place like the Kruger National Park (KNP). Isaac Phaahla, KNP spokesperson, confirmed this to Lowvelder. “We can’t break the rules,” said Phaahla when asked whether they would allow a family of four in a sedan into the park. “That would be breaking the rules.” On social media, some people have complained about these regulations, but the KNP simply adheres to the regulations, and does not make them. Tour guides, in turn, now have an extensive list of actions to follow when transporting guests according to the August 6 Government Gazette: ALSO READ: Double victory for SANParks at Rhino Conservation Awards In terms of records, a person managing a guided tour must: 1. keep a record of the full names, identity number or passport number and cellphone numbers of the people taking part in the guided tour; and 2. make such record available, should it be required in terms of the regulations or by the minister.
