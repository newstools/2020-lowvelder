The critically low Rhenosterkop Dam recorded a much-needed improvement, increasing from 1.9% to 2.4%. As we celebrate the National Water Week and World Water Day this week, and dam levels in Mpumalanga look slightly better than the same period last year, the Department of Water and Sanitation encouraged the public to strengthen water conservation and wise water use initiatives to ensure that this dry and water-scarce country of ours has a reliable water supply and water security for current and future generations. The department also encouraged communities to protect and prevent the pollution of water resources, as pollution negatively impacts on water quality and the available water fit for use.
