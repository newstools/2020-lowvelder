Sappi’s aim is to extract more value from each tree and, in doing so, move into adjacent markets to strengthen our core business model. If you have ever looked at a tree and thought that paper was the only product derived from its fibre, look around. Almost every object we use today contains wood fibre in some form.  From your touchscreen, to cosmetics and pill capsules, food packaging and so much more; it could all contain nanocellulose derived from Sappi’s innovative biotechnology solutions. • Ngodwana Mill is moving into the second phase of its sugar-extraction project, which is opening new opportunities in the xylitol and furan chemistry value chains, such as the design of a furfural pilot plant to be established at Sappi’s Saiccor Mill. We expect beneficial operation in 2021. • Construction of the 25MW Ngodwana Energy Biomass Power Plant at Ngodwana Mill, in which Sappi has a 30% stake. The plant will use biomass from surrounding plantations to generate power that will feed into the national grid. • The mill established a pilot project, producing fuel rods that comprise a mixture of waste coal slurry, biomass and lignosulphonates. This has created a commercial opportunity for sister mills to commercialise the product.
