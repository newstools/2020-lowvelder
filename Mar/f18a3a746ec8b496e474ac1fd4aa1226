During this time there have been steep learning curves, as they tread into unknown territory. “The technology has proven successful, and the project has transitioned from proof-of-concept into a commercial project proposal with real economic promise at two of Sappi’s mills,” said general manager Naresh Naidoo. The project team has developed different extraction technologies that are uniquely adapted to different mill requirements and can extract any fraction of the wood hemi-cellulose between 10 to 70 per cent as a usable product. Naresh added that the team has done a magnificent job. “The technology developed here can be classified as world-leading, with the team coming up with solutions that retain the integrity of the sugars, but also allow good operation.” The second round of economic assessments for producing xylose for xylitol is underway at Sappi’s Cloquet Mill in North America, and for furfural production here at Ngodwana. Some of the work has also opened prospects of producing furfural at Sappi’s Saiccor Mill in KwaZulu-Natal, for which a demonstration plant is envisioned to be constructed at the end of the year.
