 Dr André Hattingh and his team rode their motorcycles around South Africa. Hattingh told Lowvelder, “I am wowed and truly amazed by the support we received all over South Africa. All along the way bikers joined us. “People in major towns shut down their shops and offices just to welcome us.” The aim of the campaign was to raise the sum of R500 000 for children who need surgeries. Hattingh commented, “We can only clarify the amount we raised in about three months.” The PCA already has a list of children who will be assisted. The goal is to assist 1 000 children with operations and medication. The bikers had planned to travel 5 600 kilometres, but they biked for 7 170 kilometres. “We branched out for a few extra trips,” Hattingh said. The PCA team has started planning its next trip for 2021. Hattingh concluded, “We will meet everyone again at the same time, same place, for the same course next year.” ALSO READ: Bakkie crashes through the windows of Nashua Lowveld’s workshop, narrowly missing a technician
