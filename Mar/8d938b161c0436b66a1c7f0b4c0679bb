 Ben Nortje has braved 1 500 kilometres from Elisras to Durban to raise the sum of R30 000 for Jayden Viviers’ operation. Nortje told Lowvelder, “Jayden is currently in need of another operation. His family would like to attend the Family Hope Center Evaluation Assessment this year to better understand and overcome their unique challenges.” Jayden, a seven-year-old Down syndrome patient, is being raised by his single mother and grandparents in Lydenburg.  Nortje had cycled for Jayden previously, completing 1 000 kilometres to raise funds for his previous operation. He met Jayden for the first time on March 5. “It was great meeting him and putting a face to the name.” Both his accommodation and food for the trip have been sponsored. So far he has raised R10 883.34. He cycled 100 kilometres per day. “Not the shortcuts, but the long way around. We are making it as close to the border as possible.” ALSO VIEW: Trail hiker makes it to the summit of the highest mountain in southern Africa Nortje has been cycling for the past 15 years; not competitively but as a hobby. He then decided that he wanted to cycle around the country. “I already did my first trip from Port Elizabeth to Cape Town. Then I came in contact with the Brain Child Fund and told it that I would like to raise money for the charity,” he said. Nortje’s family is very supportive of this cause. “My family supports me big time. My fiancée helps at home; she offers personal assistance, coordinates everything and looks after our children.” The cyclist himself underwent heart surgery and therefore understands the need to help out.
