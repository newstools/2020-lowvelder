 When standing at the Eye, also known as the Soccer Ball, one has an amazing view of the city.
Fences have been built around the area with more fences to come for security. Cobus Tomlinson of the Nelspruit Local Tourism Organisation(LTO), is overseeing the project. He told Lowvelder, “We are negotiating with the council to shift one of its cameras to the area. We will place a second guard at the new entrance and provide toilet facilities for them. We will ensure that all visitors write their names in a visitors’ book. In that way we can monitor the activities around the soccer ball.” Following the repainting of the soccer ball, new handrails and a selfie-stand were also been installed on the hill.

We will print the details of the landmark mountains and hills and government buildings on these toposcopes, so that visitors can enjoy the view and spot the places. New signboards have been erected around the area. Tomlinson said the signboards have helped a little in keeping the area clean. However, they have requested more signboards from the council. These will include signs around the city directing people to the attraction. Tomlinson added, “We want to have a hiking trail as well. However, we know tourists’ safety is crucial to them, so we are working on making it safe and clean. People can come relax and enjoy the view and beauty of nature.” ALSO READ: Blood campaigns to be held in several Lowveld towns to save lives Gardens around the area will be revived, grass will be cut regularly.
