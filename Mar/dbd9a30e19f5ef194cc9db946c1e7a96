 Lynette van Huyssteen was shopping at Pick n Pay and had just arrived at the cashier when she noticed her cellphone was missing. “I had taken a call from my husband and I suspect the thief saw me put it back in my handbag,” Van Huyssteen said. She immediately alerted the floor manager, Sipho Chambale, who went to check the security footage. However, they could not pick up anything out of the ordinary. Van Huyssteen’s daughters locked the phone remotely and tried to track it.

We stopped at Tiger Wheel and Tyre, where two taxis were waiting to drive off. The taxis knew we were looking for a stolen phone, as Sipho was making inquiries with them. “We went around to Tiger Wheel and Tyre for further investigation, and then saw on the app that the thief was on the move, going fast, possibly in one of the two taxis,” she said. “We followed on the R40 towards White River and at the Emnotweni intersection one taxi was stopped at the red robot.

There are still good people in the country. This was an hour and a half’s operation,” she concluded.
