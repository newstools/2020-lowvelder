 Mpumalanga Leadership Foundation (MLF) and Nelspruit Community Forum (NCF), with donations from the community and local businesses, will together provide for the basic human needs (food, shelter and hygiene) of the homeless in Mbombela during the 21-day lockdown.  Pr TJ Maré, managing director of MLF and organiser of the lockdown shelter initiative, gave a summary early this morning of activities on day one of the shelter.
“We planned for feeding 22 to 30 people one meal in the park. We ended up serving 89 people two meals. Then we planned to provide lock-in for 35 people with a mattress and blanket; 89 people are housed, with a bed each and a place to shower. Brenda and I planned to be at NCF for two hours. We are now home, after having been on our feet for 14 hours.” He continued. “Thank you, Mbombela community, for being with us today. Your giving support showed us what a church is (not a denomination, not a building) and we give God the glory for what He has done.”  ALSO READ: Lockdown Shelter in Mbombela for the homeless  There is also a Whatsapp group that the public can join if they would like to assist: https://chat.whatsapp.com/BwjUSPYskqkIK6FBx8ynlj For more info contact, Past Maré on 082-772-6396, or his wife Brenda on 082-929-9582.
