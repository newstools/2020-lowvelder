 Tourist attraction sites managed by the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) are closed as employees are striking over a recently approved organogram in the agency.
The protesters denied visitors access to some of the province’s attractions, including the Three Rondavels, Blyde River Canyon, Bourke’s Luck Potholes, the Pinnacle and
God’s Window. Read:
MTPA labour dispute resolved The provincial secretary of Nehawu, Welcome Mnisi, said, “The workers are protesting against the current organogram, which did not incorporate the views of the union, so the staff don’t approve of
it because it will not help them in  any way.” The management of MTPA is currently engaging Nehawu on a way forward to resolve the strike as a matter of urgency. We anticipate that we will conclude the discussions by the end of the week. We would like to apologise to the public for the inconvenience caused. We appeal to visit those who want to visit our tourist attractions to avoid them until the matter has been resolved,” said Nobunga.
