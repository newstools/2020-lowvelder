 After participating in talks with other EU member states, the embassy decided to give interested citizens the opportunity to identify themselves urgently. To be able to decide on a possible repatriation flight in the next few days, the embassy mentioned this would depend on those that show interest of wanting to return to Europe. The press release stated that the embassy would hire aircraft “that will go from Cape Town and Johannesburg to some place in Europe, most likely one of the major airports in Germany”. Travellers would have to fend for themselves for further transport from the airport. They noted, “The cost, paid by each passenger itself, is estimated to amount to the equivalent of one ticket in economy plus.” ALSO READ: Influential diabetic encourages others and tells them they are not alone in educational video The release mentioned, “The embassy therefore urgently needs an interest report from those who would like to take advantage of such an opportunity. “We would therefore ask you to send an email to information.pretoria@gov.se immediately with the following information: • Full first and surname (according to passport)
• Person number
• Pass number
• Expiration date of passport
• Gender
• Departure from: Cape Town or Johannesburg (please choose a city)
• Current address in South Africa
• E-mail address
• Phone number and/or mobile number
• Possible particular distressing reasons (for example, if you belong to a risk group, have underlying diseases, are pregnant, or have families with children, etc.) “The embassy may then return with further information. There are still many practical issues to be resolved with South African authorities, so we cannot yet guarantee that this will actually happen.
