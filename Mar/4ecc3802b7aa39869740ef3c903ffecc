 “The BMA Bill is long overdue. It will enable the country to manage its borders in a manner that facilitates trade and plugs holes in our porous borders. These lead to, among others, the illegal crossing of people, illicit goods and drugs, trafficking of people, particularly women and children, and stolen vehicles,” said Motsoaledi.

It does so by establishing one command structure covering the responsibilities of up to eight different government agencies currently operating in the border environment. Minister Motsoaledi said the department had been preparing for the implementation of the BMA. The project management office tasked with this has worked with other government departments and agencies to ensure speedy implementation.
