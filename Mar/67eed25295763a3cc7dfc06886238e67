 A release issued by SANParks stated that guests will not be allowed to enter any national park, whether as day or overnight visitors, from tomorrow until further notice. “We are dealing with not only an unprecedented situation, but one that is fluid and unpredictable. Following additional advice from key government departments, it is with regret that we have to make a major amendment to decisions made earlier today regarding the closure of our tourism facilities,” the statement read. All guests from high-risk countries currently resident in the parks are instructed NOT to leave the parks. All such guests have been identified and staff on the ground will provide them with support and further information regarding their travel arrangements, as well as facilitate contact with their embassies.
