 This was in preparation for their 12-day grade 10 journey next year. On February 22, equipped with all the gear and with no idea of what awaited them, the grade nines and Uplands staff members departed from the college and arrived at Kariba Dam, where they were introduced to their facilitators from Adventure Nature Trails 4 Africa (ANTs). The grade nines were separated into groups and received their food for three days. The first activity was a fishing competition with a difference; they were tasked with making their own fishing rods first. Thereafter, the group hiked for 15 kilometres, experiencing a torrential downpour along the way.

At camp, they were fortunate enough to have a warm shower and cooked their own meals. Day two was a rainy, mud-filled and slippery affair. The groups hiked their way through pristine natural riverine forest for
11 kilometres along the Matumi Trail to the Delfonte Huts, surrounded by the majestic mountains of the Makhonjwa mountain range that has been declared a Unesco World Heritage Site. Day three was filled with a buzz of excitement and appreciation of getting back to civilisation, but they first had to conquer a 15-kilometre hike and had to ascend some 400 metres to the collection point for the bus ride home. Upon arrival back at Uplands, the grade nines and the Uplands staff were welcomed by their families and friends – and looked forward to a home-cooked meal and a hot shower.
