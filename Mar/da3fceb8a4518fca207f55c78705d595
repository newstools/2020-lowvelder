 According to reports, there has been sporadic gunfire, especially in Extensions 10 and 11. One resident commented, “We cannot sleep at night because of the gunshots.” To date, no fatalities have been confirmed. On Tuesday evening, a beer delivery truck was hijacked, its contents looted and the truck torched metres away from the entrance to Emjindini. The truck remained there
until Wednesday morning before being towed away. The strike has impacted local schools, with Laerskool Barberton and Hoërskool Barberton learners warned to stay at home in solidarity with schools in the township. This turned out to be more than mere threats, as a group of about 15 protesters entered the school by way of the stream running through Burgerville.

Shards of glass flew as they broke windows and intimidated pupils who attended school. The attack led to the school being closed until the Mpumalanga Department of Education can intervene. There is a heavy police presence in the town with public-order police and tactical-response teams monitoring the situation.
