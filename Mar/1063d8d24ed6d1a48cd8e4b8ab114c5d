 BERG-EN-DAL –  According to a SANParks statement, the post-mortem results were as follows: “The lion had a swollen left stifle joint with corrosive lesions to the cartilage of the medial and lateral condyles of the distal femur, usually associated with tuberculosis. A single granulomatous lesion was found in the left lung, also related to TB. Several pelvic lymph nodes appeared cystic and samples were collected for TB analysis. Stomach contents consisted of impala hair and some bones. The intestines were virtually empty, causing the lion to be hungry.” ALSO READ: Lion shot dead in Berg en Dal staff quarters The statement also explained the situation surrounding the shooting in more detail. “Attempting the option to dart the lion at 02:00 meant that; a helicopter would have to ferry the vet into Berg-en-Dal, further aggravating the lion, which could have acted in a harmful way. “The multiple shots that were fired first were an attempt to coax the lion out of the premises, along with other tactics. The ranger acted to the best of his ability under the circumstances to ensure the lion did not harm anyone. “An investigation into how the lion gained access into the premises was also conducted. The gate was not left open. The animal pushed his way in.” ALSO READ: SANParks remain open amid Covid-19 pandemic
