 Pupils dressed up in their favourite literary characters from novels, and comic books. The theme of the day was, “I am the Lorax, I speak for the trees. I will save the Earth”. Roneque Janse van Rensburg, from Penryn, told Lowvelder, “This is to teach the learners not to cut down trees, following the narration of The Lorax. All the teachers went all out in their costumes and the children loved it.”  Different activities happened in each class. Learners learned about trees and also painted and drew trees. The celebration is used as an opportunity for learners to give to the school’s non-profit organisation, Penreach.
