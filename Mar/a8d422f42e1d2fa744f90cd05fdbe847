This is for the 11th year running, promising the customary excitement brought to Nelspruit and White River patrons by the Cape cellars exhibiting at the show. The 2020 wine buzz in the Lowveld will include an impressive line-up of more than 30 wineries.  Savour the remainder of summer with tastings of Vini Italia’s proseccos, a Hill&Dale sparkling, unwooded chardonnays of Glen Carlou and Glenelly, the Jordan Barrel Fermented Chardonnay, Ken Forrester’s legendary chenin blancs and Neethlingshof’s gewürztraminer.  Sophisticated and silky reds will be found at the Tokara, Kanonkop, Spier and Warwick stands and for the treasure hunters, newcomer Holden Manz Wine Estate will present delicious wines from the Franschhoek valley. A full list of wines will be available at mpumalangawineshow.co.za from 16 March.
