 Ryan Pretorius, owner of Muscle Mecca, has been identified as the victim, and emergency services were able to remove his body this afternoon. The bakkie shot through the bridge railing, tumbled down onto the road underneath and hit an air valve on top of the 600mm waterpipe that supplies UMP and MMC near the Mbombela show grounds. The water supply to that pipe could be isolated by Silulumanzi, so no interruption was necessary.  ALSO READ:Â The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) arrives in Mbombela
