The biker club saw the organisationâ€™s plea for cement blocks and cement and, through the generous support of local business, members and friends it was possible for the club to donate two pallets of bricks and four bags of cement. The SPCA still has some way to go before reaching its goal of 17 000 bricks or more. Anyone interested in supporting the project can contact Fred or Nikkie on 013-753-3582.
