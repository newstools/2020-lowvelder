 Relebohile Matsimbi, donor relations practitioner of SANBS told Lowvelder, “The Mpumalanga zone is implementing a mass blood drive to recruit new donors and ensure there is sufficient stock of safe blood available in South Africa. “The slogan of the campaign is #NewBlood campaign #ThumaMina.” There will be blood drives in Mbombela, Barberton and Burgersfort. Residents can donate at Riverside Mall, i’langa Mall, Barberton Pick n Pay and Tubatse Crossing Mall.  Matsimbi said, “Currently less one per cent of South Africans donate blood. We are therefore calling on anyone who has never donated or has not donated in over a year to heed President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plea and to become the agent of change and lend a hand by becoming a blood donor, starting on Human Rights Day. #ThumaMina #SendMe”. Coupled with the launch is a grand opening of a donor centre on Saturday March 21 at i’langa Mall. Relebohile Matsimbi, donor relations practitioner of SANBS commented that, “The centre is located between at the passage between MTN and Pep Home.
