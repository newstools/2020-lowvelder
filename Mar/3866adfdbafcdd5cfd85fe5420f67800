 It is a fundraising event for the less fortunate and each year they identify a new project. The funds raised will be divided between Child Welfare, Hospice and the Lion’s Eye Testing Machine project. “The event is about involving the business sector in a joint venture to contribute to a fundraising event in a fun way,” said Lasea Swift, convener of the Bed Race. Each bed was manned by a “patient” and four pushers. During the race there were pit stops where a member of the team had to take part in various fun activities.
