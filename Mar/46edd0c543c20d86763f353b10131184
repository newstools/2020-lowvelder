 MEC of health, Sasekani Manzini, talked more about the signs and symptoms of the virus which include the following: fever, cough, difficulty breathing, general body pain and diarrhoea. She also said, “We can all play a role in the prevention of the virus by following these easy hygiene practices: Washing our hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol. Cover your nose or mouth when coughing or sneezing. Avoid contact with people with flu-like symptoms. We must clean frequently-touched surfaces like tablets, doorknobs, light switches, handles, desks, toilets, faucets, sinks and avoid contact with live animals.

Another issue raised was that of neighbouring countries’ citizens crossing our border, both legally and illegally. The premier said that the borders were equipped to handle legal crossings, but that illegal cases were out of their hands. She, however, urged people to get the proper documentation whenever entering our country so we could work together to contain and further prevent this situation.
