“We will fully cooperate and comply with their request for information. We commend our pharmacists, sisters, cashiers and frontline teams for their amazing dedication to serving our community at this time,” said the marketing manager of Mopani, Alison Blair.  “We have naturally complied with all hand sanitising, social distancing and temperature screenings for our teams as they arrive at work and have now erected “banking screens” at our cashiers and dispensaries for further protection of both staff and customers,” she said.
