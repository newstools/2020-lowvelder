 Lurina Fourie was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetics at the age of 16. She has been living with it since 2000. She decided to create this light-hearted and educational video for the families, friends and co-workers of people living with Type 1. The aim of the video is to spread knowledge and awareness regarding this type of diabetes in a fact-filled, fun way. She encouraged people to show it at schools, workplaces, and even while socialising with their friends and family members so that everyone can become a part of the change in how the world responds to Type 1 diabetes. Fourie is usually behind the camera, but decided to push her personal boundaries by featuring in front of the camera so she can help make a difference and encourage others to do so too. With a lot of planning, research, scriptwriting, scene plotting, shooting and editing this exceptional, inspirational and educational video came together. Fourie put a lot of hard work into this with the hope that it would be shared widely and she could make a difference in the lives of all people.
