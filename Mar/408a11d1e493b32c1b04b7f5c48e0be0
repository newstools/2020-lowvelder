 The Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency’s nature reserves that were closed due to an industrial action by its staff last week are now open to the public. The gates to the popular nature reserves on the panorama route like Blyde River Canyon, Three Rondawels, God’s Window, Pinnacle and Bourkes Luck Potholes are now accessible by tourists while NEHAWU continues to consult its members on the issues that they raised to the Management of MTPA. “We would like to advise the public that the affected attractions are now operational and it is safe for those that wish to visit them. There are other tourists attractions that have continued to be operational during this period and we invite everyone to explore those other offerings available within the province. “We would like to apologize to the public and most of all our tourists for the inconvenience caused by this industrial action. We would further like to dispute the negative reports that indicated that it was not safe for tourists to visit these sites as the protests were violent. We would like to confirm that during the industrial action there were no violent incidences reported and it was a peaceful protest”, explained Mr Johannes Nobunga, CEO of MTPA. “We are optimistic that although the consultations between NEHAWU
and its members are taking longer than anticipated, we will eventually reach an agreement on the issues they have raised”, added Nobunga, CEO of MTPA. We invite you to visit the various tourism attractions available in the different parts of the province and experience the wonders of Mpumalanga beyond wildlife.
