 Pastor TJ Maré, managing director of the MLF and organiser of the Lockdown Shelter initiative, said, “Today we start the journey to ready the premises for our homeless guests from Mbombela. “This is an unplanned but important time for all of South Africa. We appreciate all the support thus far, but we need everyone’s assistance to make this successful.”  The public is asked to donate the following: 1. Food and drink (water, tea, coffee or juice). The initiative is planning to feed 20 to 30 people, three times a day for 21 days. 2. Sanitiser, dishwashing liquid and laundry detergent. 3. Toiletries (soap, roll-on, toothbrush, toothpaste and toilet paper). 4. Fuel (diesel). 5. Towels (around 50 to give to people entering the shelter). 6. Gas and electricity.
