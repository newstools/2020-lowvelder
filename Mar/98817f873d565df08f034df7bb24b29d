 With the ongoing lockdown of the country to fight the spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus, public transport users and the transport industry feel the pinch.  Many passengers returning from shopping in Mbombela were stranded at the Mbombela Taxi Tank with no means to reach their homes, as taxis are only allowed to operate between 05:00 and 09:00 and 16:00 and 20:00.
