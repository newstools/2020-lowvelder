 The 49-year-old Lt Col Leroy Bruwer was attached to the Directorate of Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI). He died from gunshot wounds sustained during an attack while driving to Mbombela on the R37. MEC Shabalala has urged the police to work around the clock so that those who are involved in Bruwer’s murder are swiftly brought to book. She added that this will enable the family to begin the process of healing. Shabalala believes that severely punishing those who attack law enforcement officers, will send the message that government is intolerant of crime, especially that committed against law enforcement officers. She added that the police remain an integral part of protecting the community and those who attack them are directly attacking the state and the rule of law.

Instead, communities should actively work with the police to close spaces for criminals. “The police represent law and order. Anybody who attacks them must rot in jail where they belong,” said the MEC. Shabalala has encouraged the police to work even harder in order to protect the public even though their lives are constantly in danger. The MEC has further called on the members of the public who may have information on the case to come forward and assist the police, so that perpetrators are urgently brought to book.
