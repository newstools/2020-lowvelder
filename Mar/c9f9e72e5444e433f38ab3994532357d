 Blood in the urine and chronic back pain may indicate kidney stones or a tumour and anyone experiencing these symptoms should immediately consult a urologist. Dr Laurie Blake from The Urology Hospital, Pretoria, says in about a third of cases of blood in urine the reasons may be due to medication, food and drinks or excessive exercise. However, in most other cases, particularly when accompanied by chronic back pain, the patient may be experiencing kidney stones or a tumour which would require a CT scan or an ultrasound scan.

The kidneys form part of the urinary tract, remove waste, and are located just below the rib cage on either side of the spine. A healthy lifestyle, avoiding smoking, exercising, a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight and drinking lots of water may help avoid kidney problems. Dr Blake said kidney conditions, including kidney stones and kidney or bladder tumours are treated at The Urology Hospital. Also read:
