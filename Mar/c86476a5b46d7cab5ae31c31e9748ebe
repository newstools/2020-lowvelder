 Your best option to avoid the temptation of panic-buying is to have a shopping list to work with before you hit the store. Staple ingredients and non-perishables – such as canned, dried, and long-life foods – are the best things to buy in a situation like this.  The list below provides a guideline to shopping when you are about to go into lockdown. It is important to realise that you do not need every ingredient listed below. • Long-life milk
• Canned fruits such as peaches, fruit salad and pineapples
• Fresh fruit such as apples, oranges or pears
• Dried fruit such as apricots, dates or prunes
• Vegetables such as corn, beetroot, potatoes and asparagus. These ingredients can make a good basis for most recipes.  • Yogurt keeps well in the fridge
• Eggs
• Hard cheese keeps better than soft cheese, so look at cheeses such as parmesan, ricotta, feta and cheddar, whether block, sliced or grated.
• Buy vegetables that can last for a while in the fridge, such as carrots, beans, celery, broccoli and tomatoes.  These are foods that can generally be stored for up to three months. • Frozen fruit and vegetables
• Frozen fish
• Frozen meat and chicken
• Home-cooked meal leftovers such as soups, casseroles, pasta sauces and curry
• Grate and freeze your cheese to give it a longer lifespan
• You can also freeze everyday things, such as bread and milk, to ensure they last longer.  • Cleaning products such as tile cleaner, washing powder, bleach, and dishwashing liquid.
• Toothpaste, soap, shampoo and conditioner, deodorant, toilet paper and other toiletries you may need.
• If you have a baby, you should consider buying formula, baby two-minute-noodles, baby food, enough nappies and bum cream to last you 21 days, along with wet wipes and healthy snacks for the little one to enjoy. This is only a guideline shopping list. Take a look at your household’s specific needs and add or remove items as necessary.
