 The tradition serves as a symbol for grade eights to become fully fledged Penryn College learners. This ceremony takes place after they have participated in several activities set by the school. “They have run, jumped or thrown for their new houses at the athletics meeting and swam in the gala. They have shown their willingness to participate in the teams representing Penryn at the various interhigh meetings. The tie is symbolic of this moment,” said, head boy, Kgopotso Sedibe. There is a system where the matrics look after or help the grade eights as a sort of “mentor” during the course of the year. The initiative was launched in 2016 by executive initiative of heads of school, Hadrick Coertze and Vuthlari Shirindza. It became a tradition that was practised every year to welcome grade eights from all over the country and across borders.  Sedibe concluded, “They will represent Penryn College wherever and whenever they wear our tie. They should wear it with pride, as it is symbolic of the success of this school and the generations of scholars who have come before them.”
