 Top of the workers’ petition, which was supposed to have been handed over to the district’s executive mayor, Cllr Jester Sidell, was the policy on travelling and subsistence allowances. The workers, represented by their unions; the South African Municipal Workers (SAMWU) and Independent Municipal and Allied Trade Union (IMATU); accused the employer of not following proper procedures when dealing with their issues.  “We want the council to rescind the resolution on the travelling and subsistence allowance policy, as this policy did not follow correct processes, meaning that the workers and unions were not consulted and engaged on the matter,” explained SAMWU chairperson, Sipho Mbokane.

They have, to date, spent over R2 million in consultation fees with legal experts, money which should have been channelled to service delivery,” said IMATU chairperson, Zweli Masilela. Furthermore, the unions are calling for temporary workers to be permanently absorbed into the municipal system.  “There are workers who have been with the institution for over 10 years and yet they haven’t been made permanent.
“Instead, whenever there are new positions advertised, the municipality considers people from outside,” continued Masilela. On Monday, the unions handed over their list of demands to the municipal manager, S’gananda Siboza, and gave him seven days to implement changes. They vowed to continue with picketing if their demands were not met. ALSO READ: Bakkie crashes through the windows of Nashua Lowveld’s workshop, narrowly missing a technician
