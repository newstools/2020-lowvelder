 Surely the best invention of any ancient civilisation, guacamole has lasted through the centuries, and it is not hard to see why. The avocado contains nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, vitamin E, vitamin K and folate, and the fruit has a unique combination of fibre and healthy fats. It’s estimated that guacamole has its origins in the Aztec civilisation in the 16th century and comes from the term ahuaca-molli, which literally means “avocado mash” or “purée”. Traditionally guacamole was a mixture of mashed avo, chopped tomatoes and onions. In the modern world, different cultures have added their favourite ingredients to mashed avo and so we see the birth of “guacatology” – named by Avocados From Mexico.com. As mixology is defined as a sophisticated and in-depth study of the art of mixing drinks, “guacatology” can be regarded as the craft of mashing avo and blending it with one’s favourite traditional ingredients. Recent trends include soy sauce, rice vinegar and wasabi paste being added to traditional guacamole in Japan, while baguettes laden with guac made with shallots and tarragon is how it is enjoyed in France. As a South African, the thought of shredded biltong, piquante peppers, a dash of chutney and loads of mashed avo is sure to get your mouth watering! Imagine guacamole combined with pomegranate and lime, or how about spicy corn, black beans and chipotle? Maybe you would prefer a traditional chunky guacamole?
