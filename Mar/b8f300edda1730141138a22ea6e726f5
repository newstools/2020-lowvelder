 Wild Thyme’s opening was attended by 180 people, both estate residents and outside guests. The restaurant hosted a canapé evening for attendees. Natalie French, co-owner of Wild Thyme, told Lowvelder, “Tonight is all about giving the residents a small taste of what we have to offer, and meeting everyone. We have yet to get to know names, but we are getting there.” Wild Thyme also provides catering services to Bateleur’s frail-care division. French says it is an honour that Bateleur Estate has entrusted them with this. “It is such a humbling experience to take care of them. The elderly need attention and good food given to them at the appropriate time. All of this we will deliver,” she said. Wild Thyme is a partnership between Natalie and Paul French, owners of Gourmet Gurus, and Juliet Richardson, owner of Little Karoo. Howard Mellet, an estate resident, commented, “The opening is interesting and exciting. We look forward to great things from them. They have made a great impression tonight and the presentation is good. The food, by the way, was excellent.” ALSO VIEW: TUT students in Mbombela continue with strike Anet Vyvyan-Day, another estate resident, said, “I am happy this is happening to us.

Johann van Heerden, general manager of Bateleur Estate, said, “As soon as they have settled in, the restaurant will be opened to the public. However, guests will have to make bookings first.” Louise Snyman, director of Bateleur Estate, added, “Come and see the great facility we have and enjoy a great view with a good meal.” ALSO VIEW: Whiskymaker brings distillery’s finest to Mbombela French concluded, “We are still getting the hang of things and understanding the activities of the estate, but we have put together a great team.”
