 Eskom has just announced that load-shedding will move to Stage 4 today. This was implemented at 14:00. This follows after Koeberg unit 1 tripped. “The unit has been disconnected from the grid due to a fault on the turbine side. However the nuclear reactor remains safe. The teams are investigating the causes of the fault,” the power utility said.
