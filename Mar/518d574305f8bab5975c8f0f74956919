 MBOMBELA – The Covid-19 pandemic has hit South African shores and people in the 65 years and older age group have been identified as most vulnerable regarding contracting the virus. The disease is relatively new, with the outbreak having started in the latter part of 2019, so little information about it is available. CareChamp, the home-based care nursing agency, said in a statement, “What has been confirmed over the past few months is that the elderly and those with fragile or compromised immune systems are more susceptible to contracting the disease.” Those with serious underlying medical conditions and in the 65 and older age group, and living in assisted-care nursing facilities have been identified as being most at risk.
