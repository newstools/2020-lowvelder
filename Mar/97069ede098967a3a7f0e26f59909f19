 The I Love Local Market takes place the second Saturday of every month at the Lowveld National Botanical Garden. This month’s, however, was the last for some time as the Covid-19 pandemic continues. The market, which provides a platform for local exhibitors to sell their wares, has been postponed until further notice. “I would like to thank everyone for their continuous support,” said Peta de Wet, organiser of the event. “In light of the pandemic, we have to remain vigilant and adhere to the regulations the president has implemented.” For any queries, the public can keep an eye on the I Love Local Facebook page or call De Wet on 082-331-0712.
