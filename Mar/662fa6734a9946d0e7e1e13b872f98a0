New-generation craft producers are breathing life back into what was once a sailor’s drink.  Rum is finally breaking away from its nautical history.  Craft producers are responding to a demand for authentic, locally produced and interesting spirit brands, as the popularity of craft spirits increases, not only in the Lowveld, but all over the world.  A fun-filled day out to tantalize your taste buds in a unique way! BRANNARUM – The first-ever Lowveld craft spirit revival festival – Celebrating all things Craft! Will take place on March 28 at the Mbombela Stadium.  The festival will showcase craft spirits with the focus on rum and brandy.  Rum has come a long way. It is fast becoming the cocktail spirit of choice, while brandy has also taken to the craft market. This festival aims to showcase a different side to the old favorites and introduce new ideas and brands to the Lowveld community. Tickets are priced at R150.00 and can be purchased online via Quicket, at Cicada Restaurant in Nelspruit, as well as at the gate on the day of the event.  This is the first event of its kind and we aim to offer guests an unforgettable craft spirit experience. Our vision for this festival is to ensure that it will become an anticipated annual event. Upon entrance, festivalgoers will receive a coupon with 10 tasting coupons. Each festivalgoer has 10 tasters they can redeem at any of the available distilleries. To satisfy the palate of those who don’t enjoy rum or brandy, there will be a wine garden, gin and bubbly bar as well as other alcoholic beverages on sale at the main bar. The event promises to be fun for the whole family.  Join us for tasters, cocktails, a wine garden, Bubbly bar, Gin bar, a kiddies’ area complete with a jumping castle, colouring-in station and a special appearance from Floof – the TOPS mascot. Festivalgoers will be able to fill their belly with delicious food while being serenaded by local Lowveld musicians.
