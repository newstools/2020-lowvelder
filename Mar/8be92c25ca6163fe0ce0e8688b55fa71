The emergency procedure Silulumanzi has implemented:

1. We have imposed domestic and international travel bans.
2. We are adjusting our operations to ensure the continuity of the services.
3. Our staff are monitored regularly for symptoms of possible Covid-19 infection.
4. Upon entering our offices, customers will be required to sanitise their hands and provide basic contact details for record purposes.
5. We have reiterated to our employees the importance of strict hygiene.  The answer is yes. You can continue to use, and drink, tap water as, according to the World Health Organisation, the Covid-19 virus has not been detected in water.
Silulumanzi will continue to deliver sustainable and safe drinking water at all times.  Customers are encouraged to kindly make their payments electronically (EFT.) For easy reference here are our banking details: Bank: Absa
