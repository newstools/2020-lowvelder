 Dr Patel, in partnership with Dr Kutumela and Jina Optometrist, again provided free consultations to the public. The free service was held on March 14 and resulted in more than 60 community members benefiting. “Not everyone can afford regular check-ups, which are very important to overall health,” said Dr Patel. According to Iante-Luné Tecklenburg, marketing manager for Patel and Kutumela’s practices, the free check-ups are done twice a year. The free consultations allow those who cannot afford them to come in and be assessed, examined by a dentist, an optometrist and an orthodontist. “If the patient needs to come back for a follow-up, we also provide a discount on the appointment,” Tecklenburg explained. Patel has been practising in Mbombela for the past 20 years and continues to provide services to Lowvelders.
