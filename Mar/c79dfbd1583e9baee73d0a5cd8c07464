 The Mr and Mrs Penryn Ambassador event took place at the school’s chapel, where learners who have been involved in various community-service projects since the beginning of the year were nominated, interviewed and selected. The projects included children’s homes, the spekboom movement, and children’s hospitals. The school congratulated the winning contestants: Junior Ms Penryn Ambassador, Thando Nyoni; senior Ms Penryn Ambassador, Frances Marsh; and Mr Penryn Ambassador, Qhawe Mkhatshwa. Penryn’s Roneque Janse van Rensburg told Lowvelder, “The Penryn Ambassador Initiative gives contestants the opportunity to improve their confidence and work on their time-management skills under pressure and often out of their comfort zones. The build-up to the evening gives finalists a chance to not only work in the community and learn about themselves, but gain confidence in their abilities.” ALSO VIEW: Goodbye, Lowveld botanical garden!

The aim is to raise funds for the Penreach Play Day that takes place in May at Mbombela Stadium. She explained that the Penreach Play Day was launched in order to teach learners from underprivileged communities through play. Contestants who won will attend and assist with activities on the day.

Thank you to one and all who attended. It was lovely to see neighbouring schools and learners attend and support
their friends.”
