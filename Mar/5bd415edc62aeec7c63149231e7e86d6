 The CANSA Relay For Life (RFL) is coming up this weekend in full carnival flair. It starts on Friday March 13 at 18:00 and continues until 06:00 on Saturday – giving those who work on Saturdays the opportunity to experience all the ceremonies before 24:00. This event takes place to pay tribute to cancer survivors, caregivers and to remember those who have passed on from the disease. Relayers will have the opportunity to have access to free health screenings on the night. Remember that early detection is key to your health.

Remember to decorate your site in true carnival spirit. • Relay outfit: comfy shoes to walk the track, warm clothes for the early signs of winter, and some fun carnival outfits to show your support. • Food and beverages: remember that this is a non-alcohol event, but you are welcome to bring your picnic baskets and cooler boxes with your healthy snacks, or to support the local food vendors, so remember to bring cash!
