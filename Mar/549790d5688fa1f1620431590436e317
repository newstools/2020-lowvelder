The re-opening of the new Gundle warehouse, at 11 Stinkhout Crescent, was well attended with customers from the construction, agriculture, packaging and dam lining industries taking advantage of the great opening specials. Martin Barnard (Nashua), Rudi Jansen van Vuuren (Gundle API), Morn√© Stevens (Chick Henderson), Eddie de Lange (Nashua Lowveld).  With a strong focus on tractors, trucks, farm equipment and machinery, Gundle is a major role player in the agricultural industry and a preferred plastic supplier for farmers. Gundle Plastics materials are manufactured for African conditions. South Africa is a water-scarce country with limited resources. All sectors should aim to preserve water and this can be done by sealing dams to prevent seepage of this valuable resource. A dam liner needs little or no servicing in its lifespan. Liners ensure a watertight seal for decades, saving you maintenance costs and more importantly time. By lining your dam, you increase your effective water usage, meaning that with the water that you previously lost, larger crop areas can be irrigated. Monday to Thursday: 07:30 to 16:30
