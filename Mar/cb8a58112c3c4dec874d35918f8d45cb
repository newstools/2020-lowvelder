 Although they only suffered minor injuries, the driver and two passengers who sat in front with him were transported to hospital by Hi-Tech’s ambulance service. Witnesses at the accident said the Hilux had been speeding down Piet Retief Street in a westerly direction when it seemed as if the driver lost control at the traffic light on the corner of Roodt Street.  Wayne Lechner, Nashua Lowveld’s workshop supervisor, said he heard a colleague say something about a bakkie driving too fast in the street. “The next moment it crashed over the sidewalk and through the workshop’s windows, narrowly missing my colleague, Muzi Nkosi.  But pieces of the windows and window frame did hit Muzi and he fell down.” Nkosi was also transported to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries.
