 “The decision to create the test site was borne out of the need to decongest the emergency centre at Mediclinic Nelspruit, that was becoming overrun with patients seeking testing for the corona virus,” said Dr Steven Holt, MD of First Care Solutions that owns Urgent Care. “By moving potential Covid-19 patients to an alternative site for screening and testing, the emergency centre is better able to deal with the real emergencies that report there for treatment.”  Holt said the Urgent Care centre is adequately staffed with doctors, nurses and paramedics and will provide all normal medical services to patients, in addition to screening patients for Covid-19. Should the patient fulfil the NICD criteria for testing, the patient will be referred to the Lancet depot on site for full testing.

The medical-aid rate will be charged as per individual medical aid for unscheduled consultation. Lancet Covid-19 testing costs R990 for all cash and debit-card transactions, or the medical-aid rate as per each medical aid,” Holt said. Contrary to earlier reports and communication circulating via social media platforms, Urgent Care Nelspruit is not an official NICD or DOH testing facility.
